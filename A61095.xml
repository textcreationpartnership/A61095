            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </head>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Addreſſe unto you both, theſe ſeverall Treatiſes, not onely out of duty and obligations to your ſelves, but in regard of your publike good affection to maintain the patrimony of the Church in Tithes, which is ſo fundamental<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſetled by our Laws, that nothing can be more certain by them. And the times now growing dangerous to the whole ſtate of the Clergy in this particular, your ſelves having de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared your opinions for Tithes, and accordingly been careful to preſerve us in our rights, I hope this my ſervice will be acceptable to you: what farther may be done depends upon Gods providence, and the good endeavours of all pious men to afford their beſt aſsiſtance. Seeing the Parliament hath ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourably declared themſelves for Tithes, both by their Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and the repulſe given to ſome Petitioners againſt them. For mine own part, though I expect cenſure and oppoſition from many, yet as an Ancient ſaid, <hi>In cauſa qua Deo placere cupio, homines non formido.</hi> I have therefore in this needfull time, at the earneſt requeſt of many, adventured the rather to diſcharge the truſt repoſed in me by the worthy Knight Sir <hi>Hen. Sp.</hi> who being imployed in greater works, committed theſe to my care &amp; truſt to be publiſhed. His charge
<pb facs="tcp:62131:10"/>doth neerly concern me, and in conſcience I could not longer conceal them from the publique view. They have been long in my cuſtody; and if the favour of your ſelf M. <hi>Crew,</hi> in a time of danger, beſides M. <hi>Knightleys</hi> publique deſerts and defence of me ſince from ſcandalous people, had not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, they had been utterly loſt by the injury of ſoldiers, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with other Manuſcripts and Monuments of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence againſt the common adverſary. Your ſelves having preſerved them and me, I could not doe otherwiſe then return you the thanks and fruit of your own favours; and whoſoever ſhall think theſe worthy the publique view, will have the like cauſe to render you thanks for ſaving both them and my ſelf, being extreamly injured by ſome that are ſtyled in our ancient Laws,<note place="margin">Ll. <hi>H.</hi> 1. c. 29.</note> 
               <hi>Villani, Cocſeti, Perdingi, viles &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>opes perſonae;</hi> by whoſe troubles I am inforced to omit divers additions materiall to this argument, which the learned Knight committed to me. But leſt hereafter they ſhould miſcarry by any common danger, or neglect of mine, I could find no better means to prevent the ſame, then by committing theſe to the Preſſe, that they may live &amp; be extant for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon benefit of Gods cauſe and Church. The piety, excellent learning and moderation of the Author, all his expreſsions, will prevail much with thoſe that are truly wiſe and ſober, and if your protection ſhall concur to defend both them and my poor ſtudies, I ſhall hope to give you farther account hereafter in other works of great moment. Thus praying God to guide and bleſſe you in all your pious endeavours, I ſubſcribe my ſelf,</p>

               <hi>Quae faciunt mores vetereſque novoſque tenentem,</hi> renders him ſingularly judicious above many other, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to deliver the truth when he deſcends to ſpeak of humane
<pb facs="tcp:62131:11"/>laws and authorities, after he had firſt founded and ſetled his opinion upon the divine Law of God. Yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his piety, learning, and moderation in all his expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, there wanted not a perverſe ſpirit to oppoſe and ſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſomething againſt him, whereof hee tooke notice, and added a cenſure in his learned work the Gloſſary; and alſo among other his papers of this argument, he hath left a ſufficient apology and juſtification of his former Treatiſe, which is here publiſhed for ſatisfaction to all that be truly pious and well-affected ſons of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For his larger work of Tithes, which he prepared long a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goe, it is alſo here added, though in ſome few places imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and might have been better poliſhed by his own hand, if he had engaged himſelf upon it, and deſiſted from his greater works ſo much deſired by many eminently learned both at home and abroad: yet rather then ſuffer the loſſe of ſuch a teſtimony of his piety to God, and good affection to uphold the ſetled maintenance of Gods Houſe and Miniſters, to <hi>whom double honour is due,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Tim. 1.15.</note> as the Apoſtle ſaith, it is thought fit to publiſh it, as he left it, imperfect in ſome paſſages, and defective of ſuch ornaments and arguments, as he could have added further, out of his ſtore and abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance: though what he hath here delivered is ſo compleat, as doth fully diſcover the ability of his judgement; and that theſe reaſons and illuſtrations produced by him could hardly have proceeded from any other Author, being agreeable to his expreſſions, ſtyle, and arguments delivered in his other writings. And at this inſtant it ſeems very neceſſary, in regard the humour and diſpleaſure of many in the world, is now obſtinately bent to beat down, root up, overthrow, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, whatſoever the piety and wiſdome of our forefathers built and contributed in the Primitive times of their faith and converſion to Chriſtianity, as if all they did, were Popiſh
<pb facs="tcp:62131:11"/>and ſuperſtitious, fit to be rooted up: and as if themſelves had a Commiſsion as large as the great Prophet had from God, <hi>and were ſet over the Nations and Kingdomes, to root out, and pull down, to deſtroy and to throw down, to build and to plant,</hi> Jer. <hi>1.10.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if men will reſt ſatisfied, either with proof from di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority, there wants not enough here to guide their conſciences: or with humane Laws and Statutes confirmed, and fully enacted by many Parliaments, whereby they are now become ancient and fundamentall, as well as any other Laws, together with the conſtant courſe and practice of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a thouſand years in our Common-wealth, there wants not here the teſtimony of all our ancient Monuments, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, Deeds, and Charters of our Kingdome, Princes, and Noble men, which this learned Knight hath more fully and compleatly publiſhed in order of time, and in their originall Saxon-language, in his firſt Tome of our Engliſh Laws and Councels, for the firſt five hundred years before the Conqueſt, being his laſt work before his death. Whereunto when the ſecond Tome (which he hath alſo finiſhed) ſhall be added for the next <hi>500.</hi> years after the Conqueſt, together with his learned Commentary upon all difficult and ancient rites and cuſtomes; there will be abundant proof from all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Laws, and the authority of our Common Law, together with the practice of our Kingdome, in ſeverall ages, that no man can raiſe a doubt or exception, that ſhall not receive ſatisfaction fully and clearly. As for the Laws of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the Heathens alſo in imitation of Gods own people, the Decrees and Canons of generall Councels, in ſucceeding times, here is alſo ſuch abundant teſtimony produced, that no judicious Reader can refuſe to yeeld his vote thereto, and approbation for continuance.</p>
            <p>There is another noble and religious Knight of <hi>Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62131:12"/>Sir <hi>James Sempil,</hi> who hath ſo accurately laboured in this argument, and proved the divine right of Tithes from the holy Scriptures, inſiſting thereupon onely, and no other humane Authorities, or Antiquities, further then he finds the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> to play upon the Text, <hi>pro</hi> or <hi>contra, (as himſelf ſaith in his Preface)</hi> that much ſatisfaction may be recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from his pious endeavours; having therein cleared ſome Texts of Scripture from ſiniſter interpretations, and exactly conſidered the firſt Inſtitution and Laws for Tithes, delivered by God himſelf both in the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>If both theſe godly and learned witneſſes of the truth will not ſerve the turn to convince the judgement of ſome ill-affected, they being both raiſed up by God out of both Nations,<note place="margin">Numb. 11.26.</note> like to <hi>Eldad</hi> and <hi>Medad,</hi> among the people, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinarily to prophecy, and defend the truth, being mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved and inſpired doubtleſſe by God himſelf, (beſides thoſe that belong to the Tabernacle) to uphold and maintain his own cauſe againſt the adverſaries of his Church; yet they may well ſtop the mouths of worldlings and Mammoniſts from clamour and inveighing, and perſwade them to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce upon the known and fundamentall Laws of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: which are as ancient and fundamentall as any other, or rather more, becauſe they concern eſpecially the upholding and maintenance of the worſhip of God, then which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be more neceſſary or fundamentall: and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the pious and good King <hi>Edward</hi> the Confeſſor, doth begin his Laws with the recitall and confirmation of the Eccleſiaſticall Lawes, and particularly of Tithes, Church-poſſeſsions, and Liberties thereof:<note place="margin">

            </p>
            <p>It concerns us therefore that live in theſe times of the Chriſtian Church, when we ſee the ancient propheſie fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Kings and Princes, in giving much to the Church, to preſerve Gods portion entire without alienation, ſpoil, or violence. The Primitive times of the Church, as this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thour ſheweth, <hi>ch. 6.</hi> as had not been ſince the very Creation: times wherein God opened the windows of perſecution, and
<pb facs="tcp:62131:14"/>rained bloud upon his Church, as hee did water upon the world in the days of <hi>Noah,</hi> during the ten grievous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions in the firſt <hi>300.</hi> years after Chriſt, ſo that no man muſt expect then to finde ſetled Lawes for Tithes, Lands, or maintenance of the Clergy, when the Emperors and Magiſtrates were Heathens perſecuting the Church, and made many furious edicts for raſing and ruinating of Churches, which had been built by Chriſtians in ſome times of intermiſsion, as appears by <hi>Euſebius,</hi> when hee comes to the times of <hi>Diocleſian.</hi> Every good Chriſtian, and almoſt every Clergy-man, loſt his life for religion; no man did care or expect for preferment, maintenance, or dignity, ſave onely the crown of martyrdome, which ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſands did obtain:<note place="margin">Cap. 6.</note> 
               <hi>The Church,</hi> ſaith this Author, <hi>did all that while expoſe the dugs of her piety unto others, but did live her ſelf on thiſtles and thorns, in great want oftentimes, neceſſity, and profeſſed pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</hi> Now thoſe men that would reform all according to the pattern of the Primitive Church, and the Apoſtolicall times, do not conſider, that the Clergy muſt be reduced again to the ſame condition of poverty, want, and miſery, as formerly they were, if the pious and charitable gifts, and donations of Kings and Nobles, in the ages next ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the perſecutions, ſhould be taken away, and the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient patrimony of Tithes abated, or ſubverted by the worldly and covetous practices of them that eſteem gaine to be godlineſſe. The kytes of Satan (as this Author tear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth them) have already pulled away many a plume from the Church in ſeverall ages, yet thanks be to God, there be ſome feathers left to keep her from ſhame and naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, if the ſacrilegious humour of the times prevail not againſt her. And there is the more reaſon to hope and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that we may enjoy our portion and tithes quietly, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe
<pb facs="tcp:62131:14"/>we have ſo much leſſe then the old Prieſts and <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vites</hi> received from the people: for they had ſeverall tithes and oblations for themſelves, for the feaſts and for the poor, wherein they did ſhare in a far greater proportion then is now required by the Clergy of the Goſpel.</p>
            <p>The learned <hi>Scaliger, Selden,</hi> and many others do prove apparently by inſtance of particulars, that the Iſraelites did pay out of their increaſe of corn much more then a tenth, even almoſt a fifth part for ſeverall tithes and duties then commanded to them.

            <p>Yea, they paid not onely their tithes, but their firſt-fruits alſo, wherein they were ſo liberall in ſome ages, that even from the abundance of firſt-fruits paid by the owners to the Prieſts, there was not a Prieſt in the <hi>24.</hi> courſes of them, but might be accounted a very rich, or largely furniſhed man; as M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>Now if any motives will effectually encourage men to pay their dues with a liberall hand and eye, or deterre the hearts of worldly men from keeping back, prophaning or taking away that which hath been ſetled, given and granted by
<pb facs="tcp:62131:18"/>Laws divine and humane, it muſt be the actions and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of our Saviour Chriſt himſelf, who plainly diſcovered his zeal againſt ſacriledge and prophaning of holy things and places, more then againſt any other ſin. For when he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to execute his Propheticall office, and reproved all kind of ſins among the people, yet he proceeded to puniſh not any ſave onely ſacriledge, which is very remarkable. He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to be Judge in dividing the inheritance between the two brethren, and he would give no ſentence againſt the woman taken in adultery: but in caſe of ſacriledge himſelf made the whip, himſelf puniſheth the offenders, himſelf over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throweth the mony tables, and driveth out the prophaners out of the Temple, with their ſheep and their oxen, not ſuffering the innocent doves to remain, though all theſe were for ſacrifice, and but in the outward Court-yard of the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles:</hi> ſuch was his zeal as himſelf refuſed not to be the accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſer, the Judge, and the executioner; and this not only once but twice, at the firſt in the beginning of his Miniſtery, recited by S. <hi>John, c. 2.14.</hi> and at the laſt neer the concluſion thereof, Mat. <hi>21.11.

               </note> was the raiſing of <hi>Lazarus</hi> out of the grave, or the reſtoring
<pb facs="tcp:62131:18"/>of ſight to him that was born blind; that the voice of his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was heard at <hi>Jordan;</hi> or that at his transfiguration in the Mount he ſhewed forth his glory: but I rather think, the greateſt wonder that ever Chriſt did, was, that he being but one ſingle man, and all that time in a contemptible conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and ſo vile, that ſhortly after they crucified him, ſhould be able with a whip to drive out of the Temple ſuch a mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of men, officers, buyers and ſellers, and overthrow their tables, ſeats, and receipts, (the Scribes alſo beholding it, and ſeeing their own profit to be overthrown thereby) and doe ſuch a ſtrange thing, as a whole Army of men could not have done it at another time. But his principal end being to cleanſe and purge his Temple and Houſe of Prayer, from prophanation, ſacriledgſs, and abuſes, it plainly ſheweth us, how edious a ſin it is, to be guilty of the like abuſes: and what puniſhment men muſt expect in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed time to follow upon the like offence, though now he doth forbear ſuch miraculous proceedings in theſe latter days; when we are directed to ſearch the Scriptures ſo plainly publiſhed to us, and to take admonition from for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer examples, which are recorded for our admonition upon whom the ends of the world are come.</p>
            <p>Some are of opinion lately, that ſo the Clergy may have a competent maintenance, whether it be by ſtipend, or any way elſe, it is ſufficient proviſion for them: and becauſe divers have publiſhed their opinion this way, here ſhall be ſomething in anſwer to them. Theſe men make themſelves wiſer then God himſelf, for he required tithes and firſt-fruits in their kinde, not in money: <hi>Decimas &amp; primitias tuas non tardabis offerre,</hi> Exod. <hi>22.29.</hi> he could have appointed ſome ſhakels of the Sanctuary to be paid to every Prieſt and <hi>Levite,</hi> for the maintenance of himſelf and his family, if that had been the beſt and moſt centain: means,
<pb facs="tcp:62131:19"/>But the uncertainty of ſtipends, collections, or payments in money is ſo great, as would in proceſſe of time bring ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry great loſſes and inconveniences, both upon the people in payments, and upon the Clergy; for the change and variations of the ſtandard for money is ſo great and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain in all ages, (as this learned Author ſheweth in his Gloſſary <hi>in voce, Eſterlingus &amp; Libra</hi>—) that if an hundred pound according to theſe times, ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a ſtipend to a Miniſter yearly, it may be as much in value as <hi>300 l.</hi> or <hi>400 l.</hi> in the compaſſe of an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years following: as we finde evidently by the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of the laſt hundred years paſt; and ſo likewiſe of every hundred years ſince the Conqueſt, and before it: which hath happened of late times by the diſcovery of the Weſt-Indies, the trade and commerce thither, and the riches of their mines brought into <hi>Europe,</hi> all which may fail in the next age, or be otherwiſe diverted, and ſtopt, beyond the imagination or providence of any man. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by payment of tithes in kind out of all profits ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing by Gods bleſsing on our labours, the Clergy doe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take with the people in times of plenty, or ſuffer with them in extremities, whereas by a certain ſtipend in mony, they would be far leſſe ſenſible. Alſo the change and alterati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the fundamentall Laws of this Kingdome touching tithes glebe, oblations, and other means, which have continued in force above a thouſand years, and ſetled by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Law, will produce many miſchiefs, eſpecially to the Crown, in payment of tenths and firſt-fruits, ſubſidies, penſions, and other taxes, which amount yearly unto ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thouſand pounds to the Exchequer: all which muſt be abated and loſt to the Crown; for no reaſon they ſhould be paid when the means and maintenance ſhall be taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way; out of which they ariſe.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:62131:19"/>
            <p>Beſides the impoſsibility to provide a ſure and ſetled means in every Pariſh to pay a certain ſtipend in money quarterly to the Miniſter, there can be no caution, proviſion, or ſecurity given or eſtabliſhed for payment of money; for wee ſee by daily experience that all bonds, conveyances, and ſecurities doe fail often, whatſoever the deviſe bee for ſecure payment. No way is comparable to Gods own way of giving year<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tenth part in kinde, of every increaſing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity, and all lawfull profits, as they ariſe and grow due at ſeverall ſeaſons of the year. As for ſtipends and penſions, becauſe they have been lately invented in ſome forain Churches, in times of war, great troubles and diſtractions; I will mention only one miſchief, which is already publiſhed in print; and that is, that the beſt learned are oftentimes neglected, and put to hard ſhifts, as in the Low-Countries <hi>John Druſius</hi> lately a very painfull and learned man, well known for his ſingular works: He complains in an Epiſtle to <hi>Joſeph Scaliger</hi> before his Commentary on the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> that hee was in want of things neceſſary; and elſewhere prayeth unto God to ſtir up the hearts of the great ones to help him: May heaven and earth take notice (ſaith one thereof) how miſerable the condition of the learned is, when tithes the fixed honourary of the Prieſthood by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine right, are uſurped by the Laicks, and reward is meaſured not by true worth, or by the meaſure of the Sanctuary, which was full, running over and double to the common and prophane meaſures; but by the ignorant estimate of niggardly Mechanicks and their underagents. Many more ſuch complaints might be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alledged out of <hi>Luther, Melancthon, Calvin,</hi> and others, which I will now forbear: one great reaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb facs="tcp:62131:20"/>that their Churches for moſt part are ſtill under great perſecution, miſerable wars, pitifully waſted, being never almoſt quietly compoſed, nor ſetled by Kings and Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ours hath been; for the Emperour and many great Kings and Princes continue Papiſts, and great adverſaries to Reformation: whereby <hi>Germany, France,</hi> and <hi>Poland,</hi> have moſt ſharply ſuffered, and loſt many thouſand Churches and Miniſters, ſince the the blazing Comet <hi>1618.</hi> the people being relapſed and inforced to Popery for want of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters: which makes the reverend and learned <hi>Deodatus,</hi> Profeſſor at <hi>Geneva,</hi> magnifie the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as the moſt eminent of all the reformed Churches in Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome ſtyling it, <hi>Florentiſſima Anglia, Ocellus ille Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiarum, peculium Chriſti ſingulare, perfugium affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctorum, imbellium Armamentarium, inopum prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptuarium, ſpei melioris vexillum,—ſplendidae Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni caulae,</hi>—and much more he addeth, ſpeaking of our condition before theſe troubles.</p>
            <p>If any demand what ſucceſs the labours of this worthy Knight found among the Gentlemen of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and other places, where he lived long in very great eſteem, and publiquely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed always by his Prince and Countrey in all the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall offices of dignity and credit, it is very obſervable to alledge ſome particular teſtimonies worthy to be recorded to poſterity, and with all honour to their names, who were perſwaded preſently upon the reading of his firſt little Treatiſe (and perhaps upon ſight of the larger worke now publiſhed, more the like good effects may follow) to reſtore and render back unto God what was due to him.</p>
            <p>And firſt the worthy Knight practiſed according to his own rule: for having an Impropriation in his eſtate, viz. <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleton</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> he took a courſe to diſpoſe of it for the augmentation of the Vicarage, and alſo ſome addition to

               <hi>Ellen Goulſton</hi> Relict of <hi>Theodore Goulſton</hi> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Phyſick, a very learned man, being poſſeſſed of the Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate Parſonage of <hi>Bardwell</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> did firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from the King leave to annexe the ſame to the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, and to make it preſentative, and having formerly the donation of the Vicarage, ſhe gave them both thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed freely to S<hi rend="sup">t</hi> 
               <hi>Johns</hi> Colledge in <hi>Oxon:</hi> expreſsing many godly reaſons in a pious letter of her grant, to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance
<pb facs="tcp:62131:21"/>the glory of God to her power, and give the world ſome teſtimony, that ſhe had not been a fruitleſſe obſerver of thoſe who taught her that knowledge, without its fruit, and that love of Chriſt, without love to his Church was but an empty mask of an empty faith.</p>
            <p>Thus with devout prayers for a bleſsing from God upon thoſe which ſhould be choſen Rectors there, ſhe commended the deeds and conveyances of the Parſonage for ever to the Colledge. And this way doth juſtly ſeem the beſt manner of reſtitution, it being a double benefit to the Church both in providing carefully for the Pariſh, and ſelecting out of the Vniverſities able and worthy Divines in due time and manner without any corruption, which the Colledges are carefull to avoid; and therefore that courſe was followed by Sir <hi>Ralph Hare</hi> already mentioned, by the prudent adviſe of Sir <hi>Henry Spelman:</hi> which courſe if it had been obſerved by them who lately were imployed in purchaſing of Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations, they had freed themſelves from ſiniſter ſuſpiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, by deveſting themſelves wholly of any proſits reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to their diſpoſing, and might have much advanced the glory of God by diligent preaching, within the campaſſe of few years: and many would have been perſwaded eaſily to become contributers and benefactors to their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
            <p>Divers Colledges in <hi>Oxon:</hi> having been anciently poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed of Impropriations, have of late years taken a courſe to reſerve a good portion of the tithe corn, from their te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents, thereby to increaſe the Vicars maintenance: ſo that the beſt learned Divines are willing to accept the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vings, and yet the Colledge is not diminiſhed in rents, but loſeth onely ſome part of their fine, when the tenants come to renne their Leaſes.</p>
            <p>Certain Biſhops alſo have done the like; as D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Morton,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:62131:22"/>whiles he was Biſhop of <hi>Lichfield</hi> did abate a good part of his fine to encreaſe the portion of the Miniſter in the Vica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of <hi>Pitchley</hi> in <hi>Northamptonſhire,</hi> belonging to his Biſhoprick: and ſo did his ſucceſſor D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wright,</hi> for the Vicarage of <hi>Torceſter</hi> alſo in the ſame ſhire: which was very piouſly done, conſidering what great Lands and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours were taken away from that Biſhoprick among others, and ſome Impropriations given in lieu of them.</p>
            <p>Beſides, this preſent Parliament hath taken ſingular care to augment the maintenance of many poor Vicarages, and other ſmall Livings: wherein they have proceeded carefully, and have made many additions to ſeverall poor benefices, for the better inabling of the incumbent Miniſters to be faithfull and diligent in their callings.</p>
            <p>And while Six <hi>Hen. Sp.</hi> lived, there came ſome unto him almoſt every Terme at <hi>London</hi> to conſult with him, how they might legally reſtore and diſpoſe of their Impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations to the benefit of the Church: to whom he gave advice, as he was beſt able, according to their particular caſes and inquiries, and there wanted not others, that than<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked him for his book, promiſing that they would never pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe any ſuch appropriate Parſonages to augment their eſtates. Whereby it appears how effectually the conſciences of many men were moved with his moderate and pious per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſions: and himſelf was much confirmed in his opinion of the right of Tithes, which moved him to conſign his works of this argument, beſides others, to my care, with direction to publiſh them, as is alſo expreſſed in his laſt Will and Teſtament.</p>
            <p>Whereupon I hold my ſelf obliged in conſcience and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to God, and to the memory of this excellent Knight, to whom I was infinitely obliged for his inſtructions, confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences, and favours, which I enjoyed in the courſe of my
<pb facs="tcp:62131:22"/>ſtudies, many years frequenting his houſe and company: not to conceal theſe works any longer from the publique view, but to publiſh them to the benefit of the Church, and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, now eſpecially when prophaneneſſe hath ſo licentiouſly overflowed, and the covetous wretches and Mammoniſts of this world, have begun to withdraw and deny their Tithes, muttering that they are Popiſh and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitious, and therfore to be rooted out, as their lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage is: wherein yet the Parliament hath honourably diſcovered their zeal and care by their cenſure and check upon the Petition againſt Tithes exhibited in <hi>May 1646.</hi> and by their Ordinance providing for the true payment of all tithes, rights, and dues to the Church, as more fully appears therein.</p>
            <p>Wherein they have followed the moderne and ancient Lawes, as that expreſsion of the Act of Parliament, <hi>27 Hen. 8. cap. 20. That whereas numbers of ill diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed perſons, having no reſpect of their duty to Almighty God, but againſt right and good conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence did withhold their Tithes due to God, and holy Church:</hi> as in that Statute is more at large expreſſed. So in the <hi>12.</hi> Tables, <hi>Sacrum ſacrove commendatum qui dempſerit rapſeritve, parricida eſto.</hi> It being accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſacriledge by all Laws to take away ſuch things as have been formerly given to God: for ſo they were given expreſly to God: as <hi>Magna Charta</hi> ſaith: <hi>Conceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus Deo</hi>—we have given to God, for us and our heirs, &amp;c. So <hi>Charles</hi> the great: <hi>We know that the goods of the Church are the ſacred indowments of God. To the Lord our God we offer and dedicate whatſoever wee deliver to his Church.</hi> Cap. Car. lib. <hi>6.</hi> So <hi>Tully</hi> anciently: <hi>Communi jure gentium
<pb facs="tcp:62131:23"/>ſancitum eſt ut ne mortales, quod Deorum immortalium cultui conſecratum eſt uſucapere poſſint.</hi> So <hi>Calvin, Sacrum Deo non fine inſigni in eum injurin ad pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſanos uſus applicatur.</hi> Inſtit. li. <hi>3.</hi> cap. <hi>7. § 1.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Tithes therefore being conſecrated unto God, ought care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to be preſerved in theſe days, in regard the Church enjoyeth not the tithe of the tenth, which formerly it had, and hath alſo to this day among the Papiſts, who doe not take away from the Church, but are ready to reſtore, as they have done in many Countries.</p>

Eſay. 43.7.</note> and muſt be glorified by them, all in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, and by every of them in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. The celebration of this his glory, he hath committed in heaven to the Angels, in Earth unto Man. Yea the devils de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare his glory, and Hell it ſelfe roareth it forth. For this purpoſe he hath aſſigned unto man the circuit of the whole earth, to be the ſtage of this Action, and the place of his habitation, whilſt it is in hand.<note place="margin">Wiſd. 9.2. Ecclus. 17.2.</note> He hath delivered unto him the wealth and furniture thereof, to be the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials for performing of it: and the meanes of his main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance in the meane ſeaſon. And leſt he ſhould want leiſure, and opportunity ſufficient for ſo great a buſines, he hath commanded the heavens themſelves, the Sunne, the Moone, the Starres, yea the whole frame of Nature,<note place="margin">Deut. 4.19.</note> to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon him, to apply their ſweet influence unto him: to aſſiſt him in all his indeavours, and to meaſure him out a large portion of time and life for the full accompliſhing of this right noble moſt glorious Vocation.<note place="margin">Ecclus. 17.2.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is a rule in Philoſophy that <hi>Beneficium requirit officium.</hi> And we are taught by the law of nature, that he which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth a benefit oweth to his benefactor, Honour, Faith, and Service, according to the proportion of the benefit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived. Vpon this rule was the ancient law not oweth of England, but of other Nations alſo, grounded, that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled every man that had Lands, or tenements of the gift of another to hold them of his Donor, and to doe him feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb facs="tcp:62131:27"/>and ſervice for them, (that is, to be faithfull unto him, and to yeeld him ſome kind of vaſſallage) though no ſuch matter were once mentioned betweene them; Yea at this day, if the King give Lands to any man without expreſſing a tenure, the Donee ſhall not only hold them of him, but he ſhall hold them by the greateſt and heavieſt ſervice, viz. Knights ſervice <hi>in Capite.</hi> But God knowing the heart of man, and ſeeing that man was like thoſe husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the Goſpell, which having the poſſeſſion of the Vineyard, forgot their Lord of whom they received it; he thought not ſit in wiſdome to leave the rights and ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces due unto him in reſpect of this his ſeignory and dona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion unto the mutable conſtruction of Law and Reaſon: but hath expreſly declared in his written word in what ſort man ſhall enjoy and hold theſe his infinite benefits. Therefore ſince our owne reaſon hath taught us, that we owe no leſſe unto our earthly benefactors then <hi>Homage, Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty,</hi> &amp; ſome honorary and <hi>ſubſidiary rent</hi> for the Lands and tenements we receive of them; much more effectually muſt the ſame reaſon teach us, that we owe a farre larger proportion of all theſe unto God, of whom beſides our eſſence and creation we have received ſuch innumerable bleſſings.</p>
            <p>But as God is a Prince full of all royall munificence and bounty, ſo is he likewiſe of all abundance &amp; riches: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he neither needeth nor requireth anything of all that we poſſeſſe, as a ſubſidiary rent wherewith to enrich his coffers, or ſupport his eſtate, but as an honourary tribute towards the magnifying of his goodneſſe, and the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of our own thankfulneſſe. This, to be ſhort, is the ſum of all religion. Therefore whilſt <hi>David</hi> with admirable ſtrains of divine meditations flieth through the contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of all the glorious works of God, and of our duty
<pb facs="tcp:62131:27"/>to him in reſpect thereof, he breaketh out in every paſſage of his Pſalmes with variety of acclamations and invitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to ſtirre us up to glorify God, not only inwardly by the ſpirit, but outwardly alſo, in, and by, and with all worldly things and meanes whatſoever. And not knowing how or whereto containe himſelfe in this his paſſion of moſt bleſſed zeale, he runneth at laſt, as he were wild with it, and cloſeth up his Pſalter, with Pſalme upon Pſalme, ſix or ſeven together, one upon the neck of another, onely to quicken and inforce our ſluggiſh diſpoſition to a worke of ſo great conſequence and neceſſity.</p>
            <p>It almoſt carrieth me from my purpoſe; but to returne to my ſelfe, let us ſee in what way we muſt glorify God with theſe externall things that we have thus received from him, and that is, as before we have ſhewed, in the ſame ſteppes that the rules and maximes of his owne law have preſcribed. viz.</p>
            <list>
               <item>Firſt, that we ſhall doe unto him <hi>Homage,</hi> that is, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> true and faithfull ſervice. For it is written; <hi>Him onely ſhalt thou ſerve.</hi>
               </item>
               <item>Secondly, that we ſhall be faithfull unto him, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> as becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meth true tenents, that is, not to adhere to his enemies, the world, the fleſh, and the devill, as conſpiring with them, or ſuffering them to ſubtract, or encroach upon any part of that, which belongeth to God our Lord para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount.</item>
               <item>Thirdly, that we ſhall pay duely unto him, all rights, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> and duties, that belong unto his Seignory: for it is written, <hi>Give unto God that that is Gods.</hi> And againe; <hi>Give the Lord the honour due unto his name, &amp;c. Pſal.</hi> 29.1.</item>
            </list>
            <p>For all which we muſt be accomptants at the great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit: and there lies a ſpeciall writ of <hi>Praecipe</hi> in that caſe; <hi>Redde rationem villicationis tuae,</hi> Give an accompt how
<pb facs="tcp:62131:28"/>thou haſt carried thy ſelfe in this thy buſineſſe, that is, this his ſervice committed to thee.</p>
            <p>But omitting to handle the firſt and ſecond of theſe great Reſervations, I have undertaken the laſt, viz. <hi>de reddendis Dei Deo,</hi> of ren dring that unto God that is Gods. And in this I humbly beſeech his bleſſed hand to be with me, and guide me, for whoſe onely ſake and honour I have adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tured to leave the ſhore I crept by in my former booke, and now as with full ſailes to launch forth into the deepe, upon ſo dangerous and uncertaine adventure.

               <argument>
                  <p>The ſecond kind of tribute that we are to render unto God, <hi>i.</hi> a portion of our Land.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe ſecond thing that God hath given unto man is a place for his reſidence, and that is the earth in generall, and to every nation and family a part thereof in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar. <hi>The earth hath he given to the children of men: Pſal.</hi> 115.16. But as he reſerved a portion of the time of our life for the celebration of his honour, ſo hath he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved a portion out of the place of our reſidence. For in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 45. he commandeth the children of Iſrael, and in them all the nations of the world, that when they come to inhabite the land he giveth them, they muſt divide it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to three parts, one for the people, another for the King, but the firſt for God himſelfe. God muſt have <hi>Enetiam partem,</hi> as the Lawyers terme it, the part of the eldeſt, or firſt borne; for the tribe of the <hi>Levi</hi> (that is, his Prieſts and Miniſters) are called to be the firſt borne of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
               <p>Therefore he ſaith, <hi>When ye ſhall divide the Land for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance,</hi> ye <hi>ſhall offer an oblation to the Lord, an holy portion of the Land. Ezek.</hi> 45. And by and by he declareth how it ſhall be imployed, one part to the building of the houſe of God, and the other part for the Prieſts and Miniſters to dwell on. And this is no Leviticall precept, but an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the Law of nature; and in performance of the duty that he was tyed unto by this Law, <hi>Jacob</hi> when he was poore, and had not wherewithall to build God an houſe, yet he ſanctified a portion of ground, (when God had bleſſed him) to that purpoſe, by erecting a ſtone and pouring oyle on the head thereof, calling the place <hi>Bethel,</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:62131:29"/>that is, the houſe of God, and vowing to build it, when God ſhould bleſſe and make him able to doe it: <hi>Gen.</hi> 28.22. which as <hi>Joſephus</hi> teſtifieth, <hi>Antiq. lib.</hi> 1. <hi>cap.</hi> 27. he afterwards performed. And as God commanded the whole Nation of the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in generall, that in laying out the chiefe City, they ſhould firſt aſſigne a place unto God for his Temple &amp; Prieſts: So likewiſe he commanded every Tribe thereof in particular, that after they had their portion in the diviſion of the Land, they ſhould likewiſe out of the ſame aſſigne unto the Levites Cities to dwell in, with a circuite, or ſuburbs of a thouſand cubits round about to keepe their cattell in. <hi>Command the children of Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el that they give unto the Levites of the inheritance of their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſsions Cities to dwell in: yee ſhall alſo give unto the Levites the ſuburbs of the Cities round about: ſo they ſhall have the Cities to dwell in, and the ſuburbs ſhall be for their cattell, and for their ſubſtance, and for their beaſts: And the ſuburbs of the City, which ye ſhall give unto the Levites from the wall out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſhall be a thouſand cubits round about.</hi> Numb. 35.2, 3, 4.</p>
               <p>In execution of this Commandement every Tribe of Iſrael allotted certaine Cities to the Levites, out of their portion, according to the quantity thereof: as appeareth, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 21.41.

                  <p>That the portion of Land aſsigned to God muſt be ſufficient for the habitation of the Miniſter.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THough the portion of Land, thus to be rendred to God for his Miniſters, be not certaine, yet is it thus farre de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined, that it muſt be anſwerable to the neceſſity of the ſervice, and to the number of the Levites; that is, there muſt be Churches ſufficient for the congregations; and habitations ſufficient for the Miniſters and their families to dwell upon, with paſture convenient for their dome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall cattell. They muſt not be pulled from God with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular care, and therefore their maintenance is appointed to ariſe by other meanes then by tilling the Earth; but their habitation as befitteth ſtudents, and men of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plative life muſt be under their owne command, and ſolita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. But what, ſhould the portion of the fruites of the earth aſſigned them for their maintenance be certaine, as namely the tenth part; and not the portion of Land alſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted for their habitation? I anſwer, that as the people encreaſe, ſo alſo the fruite of the earth encreaſeth with them, by their induſtry and labour; and therefore as the Levites encreaſe in number, ſo doe the reſt of the Tribes; and by reaſon thereof there is a greater encreaſe of Tithe
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:62131:30"/>toward the maintenance of the Levite: for the labour of ten men yeeldeth more profit then the labour of five. But when the Levites were incloſed within walls, and confined with immutable bounds, this circuite in reaſon could not alwaies be ſufficient for them; And therefore being ſo increaſed as their Cities might not containe them, they muſt of neceſſity have new places of habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion provided for them. For in ſuch caſes God gave a generall rule to the people, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.19. <hi>Beware that thou forſake not the Levite as long as thou lineſt in the Land.</hi> And the people of the Jewes in this neceſſity did not forſake the Levites, for before the tranſmigration to <hi>Babylon,</hi> (which was about 840. yeares after) the Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall Cities (as appeareth, 1 <hi>Chron. cap.</hi> 6. and <hi>cap.</hi> 9.1. were growne to be about ſixty eight, <hi>viz.</hi> twenty more then were appointed by <hi>Joſua.</hi> They might not enlarge the bounds preſcribed to their Cities, but they might encreaſe the number of the Cities, as the number of the Levites encreaſed, and neceſſity required. The reaſon is, they might not adde houſe to houſe, and field to field, leſt growing great in earthly poſſeſſions they ſhould forget God, who had otherwiſe provided for them, then by manuring the earth, but if they wanted ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations, they might then ſeeke for new Cities, and the care of the people was to provide them for them. One Levite might not have more then ſufficient for his habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but if the Cities appointed were not ſufficient to yeeld an habitation for every Levite, then might they aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigne new Cities to that purpoſe.</p>

Chriſt indeed had not whereon to lay his head: for he came to his owne, and his owne received him not. But doth this prove that Miniſters ſhould neither have neſts in the ayre like birds, nor holes in the ground like foxes? Did not he that made the Vineyard in the Goſpell, build a tower in it for them that dreſſed it? So like wiſe muſt the Miniſters that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend upon the Vineyard of the Church, have their habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in it.

<pb n="7" facs="tcp:62131:31"/>Chriſt did not ſo, though he frequented the fields, yet in that he gave no Commandement that his diſciples ſhould follow him; for he appointed them to remaine in other mens houſes. What? that they ſhould goe ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journe where they liſted? The Commandement hath nothing to the contrary; but the meaning is thereby apparent, they muſt have habitations provided for them, or elſe, <hi>ſhake off the duſt of your feet againſt them, Mat.</hi> 10.14. as much as to ſay, <hi>let</hi> them be accurſed. So then our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour hath not repealed the Law of providing for the Levites, unto his Miniſters: He could not give them Cities to poſſeſſe, for his kingdome was not of this world. But he appointed them to ſuch places, as them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſhould chooſe among the children of the Goſpell. Doeth this differ from the Commandement of provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Cities for the Levites? Doubtles, no: for as the Logi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians ſay, <hi>Conveniunt in eodem tertio.</hi> They agree in this, that the Miniſters muſt have habitations provided for them, as well in the Goſpell, as the Levites had under the Law. Oh, but they muſt have no inheritance among their brethren, <hi>for the Lord is their portion. Numb.</hi> 18.24. It is true, the Lord hath communicated with them his owne portion, <hi>viz.</hi> his tithes and his offerings, as he did with the Levites; therefore as the Levites had no ſhare in the diviſion of the Land, ſo our Miniſters muſt have no ſhare with us in tilling the Land, &amp; matters of husban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry, for they are called from ſecular cares to ſpirituall contemplation; but after the Iſraelites had their ſhares in the Land they yeelded portions to the Levites for their convenient reſidence, and ſo muſt wee for our Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters. And ſo ſtill the concluſion is, they muſt be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for. Which, to ſhut up the matter, is invincibly ratified by our Saviour himſelfe, who in ſending forth
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:62131:32"/>his diſciples would not ſuffer them to take the leaſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements of ſuſtenance with them, becauſe he would put them abſolutely upon the care and charge of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, alledging a Maxime of the morall Law for warranty thereof, that <hi>the labourer is worthy of his hire.</hi> Mat. 10.10. <hi>And therefore into whoſe houſe ſoever yow en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, ſtay there.</hi> Mat. 10.11.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>What part in reaſon, and by direction of Nature might ſeeme fitteſt for God.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>It being agreed that ſome part by the Law of Nature is due unto God out of all the time of our life, and the goods that we poſſeſſe, it is now to be examined how far this Law of nature or reaſon may lead us to the diſcovery of that part or portion. For which purpoſe we muſt for a while lay aſide Canonicall Divinity, I mean the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſuppoſe our ſelves to live in the ages before the Law was given, that is, in the time of nature. And then let us propoſe this queſtion to the Sages of that world, and ſee what anſwer we are like to receive from them. And firſt touching this queſtion, What portion of our time or goods were fitteſt for God.</p>
               <p>It is like they would have conſidered the matter in this manner. That God hath not any need either of our time, or goods, and that therefore he requireth them not <hi>in tanto,</hi> that is, to have ſo much, and no leſſe. But on our parts it is our duty to yeeld unto him as much <hi>in quanto</hi> as we can conveniently forbeare over and beſides our neceſſary maintenance. So that as <hi>Bracton</hi> ſaith of <hi>Hyde,</hi> that tenants are to yeeld unto their Lords, it muſt be <hi>honorarium Domine,</hi> and not <hi>grave tenenti,</hi> ſo much as
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:62131:32"/>the Lord may be honoured by it, and the tenant not oppreſſed; wherein if a ſecond, third, or fourth part be too much, ſo a twentieth or thirtieth ſeem alſo too lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. As God therefore deſireth but an honourary part, not a preſſory: ſo reaſon ſhould direct us to give him that part, wherein his own nature with the reſpects aforeſaid is moſt properly expreſſed; for the maxime, or axiome which our Saviour alledged, <hi>Date Deo quae Dei ſunt,</hi> give unto God the things that are Gods, is grounded on the Morall law originally; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore examining among numbers which of them are moſt proper, and reſembling the nature of God, we ſhall finde that <hi>ſeven</hi> and <hi>ten</hi> above all other perform this myſtery, and that therefore they are moſt eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be choſen thereunto; therefore God in the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world following the light of nature, chuſed the ſeventh part of the age thereof, as <hi>Philo Judaeus</hi> in his Book <hi>De fabricatione mundi, pag.</hi> 36. hath with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular and profound obſervations declared.</p>
               <p>And becauſe it may be demanded hereupon, why he ſhould not by the ſame reaſon have the ſeventh part of our goods alſo; I anſwer, that as touching the time of our life, he giveth that unto us of his own bounty, meerly without any induſtry on our part: ſo that whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we ſleep, or wake, labour, or play, the allowance thereof that he maketh unto us, runneth on of its own accord; and therefore we owe him the greater retributi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out thereof, as having it without labour or charge. But as for the fruits of the earth we have them partly by our own labour, though chiefly by his bounty; and therefore he therein requireth his part, as it were with deduction or allowance of our charges, ſeeking another number befitting the ſame.</p>

               <p>The firſt place in Scripture wherein a Prieſt is men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is <hi>Gen.</hi> 14.18. where <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> is ſaid to be <hi>the Prieſt of the moſt high God;</hi> there alſo are tithes ſpoken of, and paid unto him, <hi>v.</hi> 20. <hi>Abraham gave him tithes of all.</hi>

<pb n="12" facs="tcp:62131:34"/>was then, to buy the things they had need of. And tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the proviſion of his houſe at other times, we have twice an Inventory taken of it, once in <hi>Matth.</hi> 14.17. where it was found to be but five loaves and two fiſhes: yea,<note place="margin">Mar. 6.38.

All the beaſts of the foreſt were his, and ſo were the cattell upon a thouſand hils, yet read we not that he once killed ſo much as a Calfe, for the proviſion of his family: for fleſh could not be had but for money, and money going always low with him, he uſed ſuch kinde of victuals eſpecially, as might always be ſupplyed unto him by the induſtry of his Diſciples from the common ſtorehouſe of nature, the ſea, without being beholding or burdenſome to any man.</p>

<pb n="15" facs="tcp:62131:35"/>the firſt Plantation of your Church, your ſelves being</hi> Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, <hi>have diligently preſerved the</hi> Romans <hi>cuſtome inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuted by the Fathers; which alſo your Biſhop, the bleſſed</hi> Soter, <hi>hath hitherto kept very diligently; and by his labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous induſtry wonderfully advanced: not onely in diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting lovingly unto the Saints the goods ordained to their maintenance: but like a mercifull and milde father towards his children, in exhorting the brethren (which come unto him) to vertue by bleſſed and devout perſwaſions.</hi> I report this place at large, for that this uſe continued exactly in the Church, as <hi>Euſebius</hi> reciting it affirmeth, till the great perſecution under <hi>Maximinian,</hi> and <hi>Diocleſian,</hi> which began about the year of our Lord, 304.) being the age wherein <hi>Euſebius</hi> himſelf lived, as he there alſo te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtifieth, <hi>lib.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 22.</p>
               <p>And that it was not thus in <hi>Rome</hi> onely, but in <hi>Africa</hi> and other Churches, it appeareth plainly by <hi>Tertullian in Apologet. cap.</hi> 39. where upbraiding the <hi>Gentiles</hi> with the piety and devotion of Chriſtians, he ſaith, <hi>Etiam ſi quid arcae genus eſt, &amp;c.</hi> whatſoever we have in the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury of our Churches is not raiſed by taxation, as though we put men to ranſome their Religion; but every man that will, once a moneth, or when it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth himſelf, beſtoweth what he thinks good, and not without he liſteth; for no man is compelled, but left freely to his own diſcretion. That which is given, is accounted as <hi>Depoſitum pietatis,</hi> the pledge of devotion; for it is not beſtowed in banqueting, quaffing, or glut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony, but in nouriſhing and burying the poor, and upon children deſtitute both of parents and maintenance, aged and feeble perſons, men wracked by ſea, and ſuch as are damned to the metall mines, baniſhed into Iſlands, or caſt into priſon, profeſſing the true God, and the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith.</p>

               <p>I might thus paſſe over the firſt 300. years of the Church, but I deſire to make it more apparent how the Clergy of thoſe times lived as well for converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as for maintenance. The times (to tell the truth) were ſuch as had not been from the very creation: Times wherein God opened the windows of perſecution, and rained bloud upon his Church, as he did water upon the world in the days of <hi>Noah;</hi> and as in the planting of the Law, he ſcourged the enemies of his people with ten famous plagues, ſo now in the founding of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel he tried his children with ten grievous perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; by reaſon whereof the Clergy then aſpired ſo generally to the crown of martyrdome, that they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared their bodies to this ſacrifice by the auſtereſt rules of converſation that they could deviſe, contemning all worldly pleaſure, all curioſity of meat, drinke, apparel, ſuſtenance and neceſſities, waſting their fleſh with ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence, faſting, thin cloathing, going ſometimes bare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foot, denying all things to every ſenſe, that it particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly delighted in, applying themſelves wholly to Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and Preaching, to ſupport and enlarge the Goſpel; and to be ſhort, to doe the work of Gods Vineyard faithfully in all things and laboriouſly, as appeareth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundantly in <hi>Euſebius, Nicephorus, Socrates, Ruffinus,</hi> and other ancient Eccleſiaſticall Authors. Theſe are they of whom the world was not worthy, theſe gained every man his ten talents, and ſit now in the firſt ſeats of heaven, next unto the throne of the Lamb.</p>
               <p>Touching their maintenance, the means thereof a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe chiefly (as appeareth by <hi>Tertullian, Origen, Cyprian,</hi> and others) out of the oblations of the people, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lences, firſt-fruits, tithes, &amp;c. which being continually offered at the Altar, or brought into the treaſury of the
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:62131:36"/>Church, were one while employed in common to the diet and neceſſities of the brethren and Clergy, but at length diſtributed by portions, firſt, weekly, as it ſeemeth by a decree of <hi>Pius</hi> the firſt, Biſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> in the year of our Lord, 158. after monthly, as appeareth by an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle of <hi>Cyprian ad clerum, lib.</hi> 4. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 5. to every Prieſt particularly.

                  <hi>Rome, anno</hi> 227. firſt inſtituted, that the Church might receive Lands and poſſeſſions offered by the faithfull, and then ſheweth to what end ſhe might enjoy them, namely, that the Revenues thereof ſhould be diſtribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by portions to every man, and that no man ſhould have them to his particular benefit. <hi>Vrbane</hi> himſelf in the Decretall Epiſtle attributed unto him, affirmeth this uſage to be more ancient, ſaying alſo, that the Biſhops within their Dioceſe, and other faithfull perſons (ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by them) both did and ought to diſtribute theſe Revenues in manner before mentioned; adding further that they were called the oblations of the faithfull, for that they were offered unto God, and that they ought not to be otherwiſe employed then to Eccleſiaſticall uſes, the relief of Chriſtian brethren, living together in common, and of the poor people, for that they are the vows of the faithfull, the price of ſin, the patrimony of the poor, and delivered over unto the Lord for the performance of this work. Many account this Epiſtle Apocryphall, I will therefore ſtrengthen it with the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion of <hi>Origen</hi> a Father of thoſe times, who in his 16.

And to ſhew to what end the Church enjoyeth her goods, and in what manner they ought to be divided amongſt her
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:62131:39"/>Miniſters and poor children, in his 31. Homily upon <hi>Matthew</hi> he ſaith—<hi>Opus habemus ut fideles ſimus pariter &amp; prudentes ad diſpenſandos eccleſiae reditus, &amp;c.</hi> It behoveth us to be faithfull in diſpoſing the rents of the Church. <hi>Faithfull,</hi> that we our ſelves devour not thoſe things which belong unto the widows, and that we be mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full of the poor; and becauſe it is written, <hi>The Lord hath appointed that they which preach the Goſpel,</hi>

                  <hi>ſhould live of the Goſpel;</hi> that we therefore take not occaſion to ſeek more for our ſelves then our ſimple diet, and neceſſary apparell: retaining a greater portion to our ſelves then that we give to the brethren that are hungry and thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty, and naked, and which ſuffer neceſſity in ſecular af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs. <hi>Diſcreet:</hi> as to miniſter to every man his portion, according to his rank and dignity; remembring that which is ſaid, <hi>Bleſſed is he which conſidereth the poor and needy, Pſal.</hi> 41. for it is not ſufficient for us, ſimply to give away the goods of the Church; ſo to keep our ſelves clear from devouring or ſtealing of them, but we muſt wiſely conſider every mans neceſſity; how he fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth into it, what his dignity is, how he came by it, how much he needeth, and for what cauſe he needeth it. We muſt not therefore deal alike with them which were pincht, and hardly brought up in their infancy, and with them who being nouriſhed delicately and plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully are now fallen into neceſſity. Neither muſt we mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter the ſame things to men and to women, nor like quantity to old men, and young men; nor to ſickly young men that are not able to earn their living, and thoſe w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> have ſomwhat of their own to maintain them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves withall. It muſt alſo be conſidered whether they have many children; and whether thoſe children be idle, or induſtrious; and how far forth they are inſufficient
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:62131:39"/>to provide for themſelves: to bee ſhort, there is great wiſdome required in him that would well diſpoſe the Revenues of the Church, and that by being a faithfull and diſcreet diſpoſer hee may become an happy man. Thus far <hi>Origen;</hi> to which purpoſe <hi>Cyprian</hi> alſo in his Epiſtle to <hi>Eucratius, lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Epiſt.</hi> 10. ſheweth that the Church maintained many poor, and that her own diet was <hi>frugalioribus &amp; innocentibus cibis,</hi> ſparing and plain, and all her expence, <hi>ſumptibus parcioribus quidem ſed ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutaribus,</hi> full of frugality, but ſufficient for health.</p>
               <p>The perſons by whom this diſtribution of Church goods was made, were chiefly the Biſhops (as appeareth by the former Epiſtle of <hi>Vrbane</hi>) and Deacons appointed under them as in the times of the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 6. Therefore <hi>Origen</hi> in his 16. Homily upon <hi>Matthew, fol.</hi> 31. <hi>col.</hi> 4. taxing the unfaithfull Deacons ſaith, <hi>Diaconi autem, &amp;c.</hi> But the Deacons which govern not well the tables of the Eccleſiaſticall money, (that is, the goods and Revenues of the Church) but doe always purloin them, not diſtributing that which they give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording unto judgement; and ſo become rich by that which belongeth unto the poor; they are the Exchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers whoſe Tables Chriſt will overthrow. For the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles in their Acts teach us, that the Deacons are Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours of the Tables of Eccleſiaſticall moneys, (or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues) &amp;c. and again after,—<hi>unuſquiſque diaconorum.</hi> Every one of the Deacons which gather wealth to themſelves by defrauding the poor, let them now ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand this Scripture, that they gather no more, leſt the Lord commeth upon them, and overthrow the Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles of their diſtribution.</p>

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:62131:40"/>whereby it plainly appeareth, that no Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon enjoyed any thing belonging to the Church to his own benefit; but that the Church-men had out of the Revenues and goods of the Church, ſo much onely as ſufficed for their neceſſary maintenance in meat, drink, cloth, and ſuch like: the ſurpluſage being faithfully employed to the relief of the poor, the needy, the wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows, perſons baniſhed for Religion, or impriſoned, Captives, and Chriſtians any way diſtreſſed. So that the Church expoſing all this while the dugs of her pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto others, did live her ſelf on thiſtles, and thorns, that is, in want, neceſſity, and profeſſed poverty.</p>
               <p>When the flood of perſecution had prevailed as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years againſt the Church in the time of the Goſpel, as that of waters did days againſt the wicked in the time of <hi>Noah;</hi> and that <hi>Conſtantine</hi> like the Dove of the Ark had brought the olive branch of peace unto the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God: the Church then began to ſmell the ſweet ſavour of reſt, and changing preſently her diſpoſition with her fortune, changed alſo the very policy of her government: before in poverty, now in riches; before a ſervant, now a Miſtreſſe; before a Captive, now a Conquerour. For the noble <hi>Conſtantine</hi> being miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly converted to the faith, did not onely free her from perſecution, but ſetled her alſo in the very boſome of peace, raiſed her to honours, endowed her with poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, eſtabliſhed her with immunities; and to be ſhort, poured upon her the fulneſſe of his regall munificence. Inſomuch, that many prudent Fathers foreſeeing then another evill likely to proceed from hence; as namely, that her plenty might make her wanton, and forgetfull of her duty, began now to diſpute whether it were law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full for her to accept lands and Temporalties, or not:
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:62131:40"/>Some alledged that the examples of our Saviour and his Apoſtles bound them to contemn the world, and to live in a ſtrict and Stoick kind of poverty. Others conceived that courſe to be but temporall, and like a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinall diet preſcribed by Phyſitians to their patients in ſickneſſe onely, not in health? affirming the time to be now come, when it pleaſed God to crown the long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering of his Church, with the bleſſings promiſed in the tenth of <hi>Mark, v.</hi> 29.31. <hi>That ſince they had forſaken houſe, and brethren, and ſiſters, and father, and mother, and wife, and children, and lands for Chriſts ſake and the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel; they ſhould receive un hundred fold now at this preſent, with their perſecutions, and in the world to come eternall life.</hi> I will not argue this point, but letting paſſe the School-men, will reſt my ſelf upon the determination of many ancient Councels, Fathers, and Doctors of the Church, who with one conſent conclude affirmatively, that the Church may hold them.</p>
               <p>And I think their opinion to be of God, for that it hath prevailed theſe 1500. years againſt all the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies thereof, though the Kytes of Satan have pulled many a plume from it.</p>
               <p>To return to <hi>Conſtantine;</hi> though he and others by his example did abundantly enrich the Church, yet did not the Church-men take theſe riches to the benefit of themſelves, and their families, but employed them as before to workes of charity, Yea, <hi>Silveſter</hi> himſelfe, though the ſea of theſe things flowed into his boſome, and were at his pleaſure, yet took he as ſparingly of them, as if he had been but a little pitcher, ſuffering the whole ſtreams thereof to run abundantly amongſt the children of the church, and poor people, as did alſo the other Fathers, Prieſts, and Clergy of that time, who
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:62131:41"/>reckoned not otherwiſe of riches then as dung, which being ſpread and ſcattered in the fields of God, might make them the more fertile. For the reſolution then was (as in the age before) that no Church-man might take Lands to his private uſe, nor the Church her ſelf otherwiſe then for works of charity, and the neceſſary ſuſtenance of her Miniſters, not to make ſtocks or por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for them in earth, whoſe inheritance was in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and that had God himſelf for their portion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Proſper</hi> a godly Father of that time,<note place="margin">Lib. <hi>21.</hi> de vita Contemplativa.</note> whoſe authority is often uſed in the Councel of <hi>Aquiſgrane,</hi> diſputing the point, concludeth it thus; If every Miniſter of the Church have not a Living, the Church doth not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide one for him in this world, but helpeth him with things neceſſary, that he may receive the reward of his labour in the world to come, reſting in this life upon the promiſe of our Saviour. To which purpoſe he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the place in the 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.14. What is it to live of the Goſpel, but that the labourer ſhould receive his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries from the place wherein he laboureth? And a little before him, <hi>Hierome</hi> alſo in his Book <hi>De vita Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nach. Cler. inſtituenda</hi>— ſaith,<note place="margin">Epiſt. ad Nepo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianum.</note> If I be the Lords part and the lot of his inheritance, not having a part amongſt the reſt of the Tribes; but as a Levite and Prieſt doe live of tithes, and ſerving at the Altar, am ſuſtained by the offerings of the Altar: having victuals and cloathing, I will be contented herewith, and being otherwiſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, will follow the naked croſſe. So in his Book <hi>De Co. virginitatis,</hi> having reproved the curioſity of ſome Clerks of that time, he ſaith alſo, <hi>Habentes victum &amp; veſtitum his contenti ſumus:</hi> for as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Eſay</hi> 1. <hi>Tom.</hi> 2. <hi>In officio clericatus lucrum non pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum, ſed acquiritur animarum.</hi> In the function of a

               <p>All theſe are but particular opinions of ſome We<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtern Fathers: hear now therefore the determination of the Eaſtern church aſſembled in the Councell of <hi>Antioch, Anno</hi> 340. <hi>cap.</hi> 25. <hi>Epiſcopus Eccleſiaſticarum rerum habeat poteſtatem, ad diſpenſandum erga omnes qui indigent, cum ſumma reverentia, &amp; timore Dei; participet autem &amp; ipſe, quibus indiget, tam in ſuis, quàm in fratrum qui ab eo ſuſcipiuntur, neceſſariis uſibus, profuturis, ita ut in nullo qualibet occaſione fraudentur, juxta ſanctum Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtolum ſic dicentem, Habentes victum &amp; tegumentum his contenti ſumus.

               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Proſper</hi> proceedeth further, and will not ſuffer that a Miniſter able to live of himſelf ſhould participate any thing of Church goods. <hi>Nec illi qui ſua poſſidentes, &amp;c.</hi> For ſaith he, <hi>They which have of their own, and yet deſire to have ſomewhat given them of that whereon the poor ſhould live, doe not receive it without great ſinne. The holy Ghoſt ſpeaking of Clerks (or Clergy-men) ſaith,</hi> They eat
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:62131:42"/>the ſins of my people. <hi>But as they which have nothing of their own, receive the food they have need of, and not the ſins: ſo they which have of their own receive not the food (which they abound with) but the ſins of other men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Therefore though the Councell of <hi>Antioch, An.</hi> 340. <hi>Can.</hi> 25. ordained that the Biſhops might diſtribute the Church goods, yet would it not ſuffer them to take any portion thereof to the uſe of themſelves, or of the Prieſts and brethren that lived with them, unleſſe neceſſity did juſtly require it, uſing the words of the Apoſtle, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.8. <hi>habentes victum &amp; tegumentum his contenti ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus;</hi> having food and raiment let us be there with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented. And decreed further, that if the Biſhops ſhould not be ſatisfied, but did employ any goods of the Church, to their kindred, brethren, or children, they ſhould anſwer it at the next Synod. So likewiſe tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching Prieſts, as the words ſubſequent imply: and as <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chilles Statius</hi> expoundeth it, <hi>pag.</hi> 14. for the Prieſts at that time had nothing but by the aſſignment of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops: and if the Biſhops themſelves might take no more then onely for their neceſſity, we may eaſily judge what the inferiour Clergy might doe.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Gregory</hi> looking upon 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.7, 8. where it is ſaid, <hi>You ought to follow us, we take no bread of any man for nought; and that he which will not work, ſhould not eat:</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth theſe to the Clergy, and concludeth that though ſuch kind of Miniſters have never ſo much need, yet they muſt not participate the food of their function or Church Revenues; for ſaith he, <hi>Penſemus cujus damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionis ſit, &amp;c.</hi> let us think with our ſelves how great damnation it is to receive the reward of labour without labour. Behold, we (the Clergy) live of the oblations of the faithfull; but what? doe we labour to get the
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:62131:42"/>goods and cattell of the faithfull? doe we take thoſe things for our wages which the faithfull have offered for the redemption of their ſins; and doe we not ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly labour as we ought to doe, againſt thoſe ſins, by induſtry of prayer and preaching?</p>

                  <hi>Selden</hi> in his Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory, <hi>c.</hi> 6. where he ſheweth when Tithes began to be commanded by Laws and Synods, and withall giveth the reaſon out of <hi>Agobardus</hi> a very learned Biſhop of <hi>Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> (as he truly ſaith of him) why Councels did not at firſt make canons touching Tithes and gifts to the church: which <hi>Agobardus</hi> ſpeaketh touching generall Councels; but Provinciall Councels did frequently command them, as will appear by the collections fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing here, <hi>cap.</hi> 20. <hi>Agobardus</hi> words are conſiderable, in his Book <hi>De diſpenſatione contra ſacrilegos,</hi> p. 176. <hi>Jam verò de donandis rebus &amp; ordinandis eccleſiis, nihil unquam in Synodis conſtitutum eſt, nihil à ſanctir patribus publicè praedicatum: nulla enim compulit neceſſitas, fervente ubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que religioſa devotione, &amp; amore illuſtrandi eccleſias ultro aeſtuante, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Concerning giving of goods, and endowing of churches, nothing hath over been decreed in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, nothing publickly promulgated by the holy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for no neceſſity required it, the religious devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and love of beautifying the churches every where
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:62131:43"/>abounding of their owne accord. At firſt religious chriſtians ſold all their lands,<note place="margin">Acts 4.34, 35.</note> goods, houſes, and poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſions, laying down the money at the Apoſtles feet, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.45. and long after the Apoſtles time devotion and zeal in this kind was ſo fervent, that there was no need of laws, but when this zeal began to waxe cold in the next Ages following, then laws and canons were made more carefully for Tithes and maintenance.</p>
               <p>Many Kings and Princes alſo were ſo pious and carefull, that the full tenth ſhould be paid, that they made ſeverall lawes to pay a ninth part, that ſo they might bee ſure to pay more rather then leſſe then a tenth: <hi>Ex propenſiori in Deum animo ultra decimas, nonas dabant pii:</hi> As this Authour proveth by very many laws alledged in his learned Gloſſary, which ſhall be produced in due place and time: and <hi>cap.</hi> 11. here fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing prudently obſerveth: How many things in the beginning both of the Law and Goſpel, were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and omitted for the preſent, and reformed afterward: for when the Law was given, the wheels thereof could not preſently fall into their courſe; and ſo likewiſe in the New Teſtament, the Apoſtles themſelves are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to many neceſſities, and to ſuffer many things which were reformed afterwards.</p>
               <p>To which diſcourſe I leave the Reader, who may thence receive ſatisfaction, why laws and canons for Tithes and maintenance were not made in the firſt A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſo exactly and carefully as afterwards they were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacted both by Temporall and Eccleſiaſticall powers.</p>
               <p>But as others alſo obſerve for ſucceeding times; Churches and Tithes were both miſerably overthrown and loſt in moſt of theſe Weſtern parts of the Empire, by the Invaſion of the barbarous people, <hi>Hunnes, Goths,</hi> and
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:62131:43"/>
                  <hi>Vandals,</hi> upon the Chriſtian world, who firſt invading <hi>Italy</hi> under the Emperour <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> did miſerably ſpoil and harrow the Countrey, perſecuted the Clergy, pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led down Churches, robbed Biſhops, and Colledges, overthrew ſchools of learning, and committed all ſorts of wickedneſſe: and afterwards they ſet their face a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt <hi>France,</hi> where to oppoſe them <hi>Charles Martell</hi> would not encounter, unleſſe the inferiour Clergy would yeeld up their Tithes into his hands to pay his Armies and Soldiers: for which ſacriledge hee is infamous in the publick Hiſtories to this day, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally becauſe he did not reſtore the Tithes to the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy, according to his ſolemn promiſe, after God had bleſſed him with good ſucceſſe, killing many thouſands in one great battail. This fact of <hi>Martell</hi> was done about the year 660. Chr. and no redreſſe of it till the Councel of <hi>Lateran,</hi> neer five hundred years after, <hi>Anno</hi> 1189. under <hi>Alexander</hi> the third; and this was the firſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence that ever Tithes ſuffered in the Chriſtian world, after they left the Land of <hi>Jewry</hi> and came to inhabite among Chriſtians. But by that foot of <hi>Charles Martell</hi> it appears, that the Clergy in his time did hold and receive Tithes, and doubtleſſe by vertue of laws and canons made in former times, (witneſſe the Councell of <hi>Maſcon, Anno</hi> 586.) and not ſo late as about the year 800. which ſome doe pretend. For that Councell of <hi>Maſcon, Can.</hi> 5. doth affirm, and take them as due by au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and laws of ancient times, and alſo by the Word of God, and that they were paid by the whole multitude of Chriſtians. So the words of the Canon are expreſly. <hi>Leges divinae conſulentes ſacerdotibus ac miniſtris eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arum pro haereditaria portione omni populo praeceperunt decimas fructuum ſuorum, —quas leges Chriſtianorum
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:62131:44"/>congeries long is temporibus cuſtodivit intemeratas.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here is no ſmall teſtimony as well of ancient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice in paying of them, as of great opinion, for their being due; ſaith M. <hi>Selden, ca.</hi> 5. § 5. and ſo <hi>Spelman, ca.</hi> 18. <hi>infra.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So alſo the phraſe uſed in the fourth Councell of <hi>Arles. Vt Eccleſiae antiquitus conſtitutae nec decimis, nec ulla poſſeſsione priventur;</hi> and other Provincials of that time, and Laws of <hi>Charlemain</hi> agree with it, ſaith M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Selden;</hi> and thoſe phraſes muſt needs refer back to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times. So <hi>Boniface</hi> an Engliſhman, Biſhop of <hi>Ments,</hi> in an Epiſtle to <hi>Cuthbert</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury</hi> (<hi>Spelman Concil. p.</hi> 241.) ſpeaketh of ſome negligent and unworthy Miniſters that did receive Tithes and profits, but did not carefully perform their duties: wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by it appears that Tithes were then paid, though ſome unworthy men received them. And though the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginall right be due to God himſelf, yet becauſe hee hath aſſigned over his right to the Prieſts in the old Law, and now to the Miniſters of the Goſpel, therefore they are to be paid to the Prieſt or Miniſter; for hee is the Steward of Gods houſe, and in this point no man muſt reſpect what condition he is of: for the debt is due to his Maſter, not to himſelf; ſo that whether he be good or bad, what condition ſoever he be of, hee ſtandeth or falleth to his own Maſter, as <hi>Spelman</hi> ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, <hi>Cap.</hi> 14.</p>

                  <p>The <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple were thoſe that ſerved about the Temple, and were (as I ſay) inſtituted by <hi>David,</hi> but inducted by <hi>Solomon.

The <hi>Levites</hi> of the Temple were of two ſorts, one <hi>Levites</hi> and Prieſts, the other <hi>Levites</hi> onely: In the function of the Prieſts, he changed little ſave the place of their ſervice, not the manner; before they ſerved in the Sanctuary of the Tabernacle, now he removeth them to the Sanctuary of the Temple.</p>

                  <p>The Provinciall <hi>Levites</hi> are thoſe whom he ſevered from the Temple, and placed abroad in the Country to be rulers over the people, both in matters pertaining to God, and the affairs of the King, that is, ſpiritually and temporally; ſome to be Judges, ſome to be other Officers in the Common-wealth: 1700. of them he ſet on the Weſt-ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> and 2700. on the Eaſt-ſide, chief Fathers, and all worthy men, <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.30. <hi>&amp;</hi> 32.<note place="margin">Iudices autem populi &amp; ſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas eorum <hi>6000.

                     <hi>Joſephus</hi> counteth the <hi>Levites</hi> of this kinde with their Scribes, as he calleth them, to be 6000. whereby it appeareth that the ſect of the Scribes belonged to the Judges.</p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>David</hi> made a new form of the ſervice of the <hi>Levites,</hi> far differing from the firſt: yet the Tithes ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the firſt, remained over to the ſecond ſort: and thoſe that medled not with the Temple and holy things, namely, the Provinciall <hi>Levites,</hi> had their part in the Tithe as well as the Templar <hi>Levites;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore as the alteration of the ſervice, whereto they were firſt ordained, took not away the wages allotted to them: ſo the ſecond alteration of their ſervice, name<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this of the Goſpel, ought not to take from the <hi>Levites</hi> thereof, our Miniſters, the Tithe before paid to the two former kind of <hi>Levites;</hi> I mean them of the Taberna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and of the Temple. The Templar <hi>Levites</hi> were delivered from bearing the burden of the Tabernacle, and yet had the Tithes; therefore the <hi>Levites</hi> of the Goſpel muſt have their Tithes, though they be deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered from bearing the burden of the Law, and ceremo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies thereof.</p>
                  <p>Though this diſtinction of Templar and Provinci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>Levites</hi> may ſeem new to ſome men,<note place="margin">Note.</note> yet it is plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:62131:47"/>grounded upon the Text, and is very materiall to be obſerved for many purpoſes. At firſt whiles the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the <hi>Levites</hi> and Prieſts was not very great, they all attended at the Tabernacle at <hi>Shilo,</hi> firſt, or elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where: But when the Temple was built by <hi>Solomon,</hi> and that Tribe greatly encreaſed, they attended by cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (which was before deſigned by <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) and then it fell out but one week in an half yeer to each to attend at the Temple: for the Prieſts being divided into 24. courſes, and ſo likewiſe the <hi>Levites</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to 24. no courſe could come oftner about, then once in 24. months, or a week in every half year, which indeed was their uſage, as <hi>Joſephus</hi> ſheweth; and ſo <hi>Scaliger</hi> and <hi>Salianus,</hi> with other accurate Chronolo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</p>
                  <p>Now the whole Tribe being ſo mightily encreaſed in <hi>Davids</hi> time, as that there were 38. thouſand <hi>Levites</hi> beſides the Prieſts, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.3. <hi>Magnus ſanè numerus pro iſto populo, ut facilè intelligas multos ornatui magis ſerviiſſe quàm neceſſitati:</hi> as <hi>Grotius</hi> there ſaith.</p>
                  <p>Therefore God employed them for many uſes more then to attend at the Temple: ſome were deſigned for other employments in the Common-wealth, and they applied other ſtudies, as being the chief men for nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and dignity, and alſo for learning and knowledge in that Common-wealth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cum pingue haberent otium, non tantum omnia legis, ſed &amp; medicinae, aliarumque artium diligentes ediſcebant, ut &amp; Aegyptii ſacerdotes, ideoque primis ſeculis, ex illis, ut eruditioribus Senatus</hi> 70 <hi>virûm legi maxime ſolebat.</hi> Gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius in Deut. 17.</p>
                  <p>There was no other Academy or School then in the whole world, but at the Temple among them, where
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:62131:47"/>the knowledge of Gods law, or learning in any kinde could bee gained: The adminiſtration of law and juſtice throughout the kingdome depended on them principally; <hi>for God made his covenant with</hi> Levi <hi>of life and peace. The law of truth was in his mouth. The Prieſts lips ſhould preſerve knowledge, and they ſhould ſeek the law at his mouth:</hi> Mal. 2.5, 6, 7. and ſo <hi>Ezek.</hi> 44.23. <hi>They ſhall teach my people the difference between the holy and prophane, and cauſe them to diſcern between the unclean and the clean: and in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie they ſhall ſtand in judgment, &amp; they ſhal judg accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to my judgements: and they ſhall keep my laws, and my ſtatutes in all mine aſſemblies:</hi> they being the principall Judges and Lawyers in that Common-wealth of Gods own conſtitution. And whereas it is now granted on all hands, that there was 3. Courts of Juſtice in that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; 1. the great Councel of 70. Elders; 2. the Court of Judgement conſiſting of 23. 3. the Court of three, or ſome few more: the Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> were prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipall men, both Judges and Officers in all Courts, <hi>Scophtim &amp; Schoterim,</hi> as 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23.4. both to give ſentence and judgement, and alſo to execute the ſame: ſo the Divines doe affirm alſo in their late Annotations, upon 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.29, 30. and 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 19.8.11. They did ſtudy the Judiciall and Politique laws, and had power to ſee the law of God, and injunctions of the King to be obſerved, and to order divine and humane affairs. And they held alſo other honourable offices:<note place="margin">1 Chron. 26.1.</note> for we read that <hi>Zechariah</hi> a <hi>Levite</hi> was a wiſe Counſellor.

                  <p>And becauſe ſome have doubted whether they were imployed in the adminiſtration of juſtice, it is more clearly of late evinced then formerly hath been: for be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides <hi>Sigonius, Bertram, Caſaubon, Moulin,</hi> and divers o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, the learned <hi>Hugo Grotius,</hi> in his Annotations up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Matthew, cap.</hi> 5.21. hath very accurately proved it out of the Text, <hi>Joſephus, &amp; Philo,</hi> and other monuments of the <hi>Jews</hi> (whoſe teſtimonies at large I cannot now recite) that there was no diſtinction, nor diviſion of the Courts of Juſtice, the one Eccleſiaſticall, the other Civill, but the Courts were united, and the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> the principall Judges and officers in every Court, to whom the people were to be obedient upon pain of death, <hi>Deut.</hi> 17.12. they being appointed to <hi>hear every cauſe between bloud and bloud, between plea and plea, and between ſtroke and ſtroke, being matters of controverſie within thy gates;</hi> and as our Lawyers call them, Pleas of the Crown, and Common pleas, or whatſoever elſe did ariſe among them. The Provinciall <hi>Levites</hi> were eſpecially appointed to the Courts of Juſtice, and alſo the Templar <hi>Levites,</hi> when they had performed their courſes, (and went home to their own houſes) being but one week in half a year, were at very good leiſure to aſſiſt the people in every Tribe, where their Cities were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotted to them, in governing, ruling, and directing in all matters pertaining to God and the King, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 26.30.32. for which purpoſe God did ſcatter them in every Tribe, and turned the curſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> into a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular bleſſing,<note place="margin">Gen. 49.7.</note>

<pb n="41" facs="tcp:62131:48"/>appointing 1700. to be on the weſt-ſide <hi>Jordan,</hi> and 2700. on the Eaſt-ſide.</p>
                  <p>The ancient frame of our Common-wealth, for 500. years before the Conqueſt, was thus diſpoſed and gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, as this learned Authour ſheweth fully in his Gloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary and Councels; and happy had it been if things had ſo continued ſtill: but now the law being otherwiſe ſetled, and the Courts divided, it is not ſafe, or eaſie to make alteration.</p>

The firſt belonged to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the ſecond to them of the Circumciſion, the third to us under grace. The third came in lieu of the ſecond, and the ſecond riſe out of the firſt, which was from the beginning, and the work of nature:<note place="margin">Erant nihilomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus ea tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate ſacrdotes, nec dum adhuc à lege ordinati, ſed naturali ſapientia hoc requirente &amp; perficiente. l. <hi>11.</hi> in Iob p. <hi>2.</hi>

Thus was Prieſthood inſtituted, corrupted, and reformed e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:62131:49"/>in the beginning. <hi>Cain</hi> (for ought that here appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth to the contrary) began it, and likewiſe corrupted it; <hi>Abel</hi> continued, and reformed it: but ſome rather think (and ſo ſaith <hi>Hugo</hi>) that <hi>Adam</hi> taught it to his children: and this to me ſeemeth more likely,<note place="margin">

               <p>By this example of <hi>Noah,</hi> the exerciſe of ſacrificing grew common (no doubt) with the people of that time, and after in the confuſion of languages to be diſperſed through all Nations, who loſing their originall faith with their originall tongue, and falling ſo to idolatry, applied this holy function to the worſhip of idols and devils. Amongſt which, notwithſtanding, (as here and there an ear of wheat, in a field of thiſtles) God had his ſervants, who from time to time, and age to age, tradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing this holy myſtery (as ſacred fire) to poſterity, kept it ever in the originall integrity.

               <p>VVHen our Saviour preſcribed his Diſciples to take nothing with them, but to live at the charge of them into whoſe houſes they entred; this was a law to bind the faithfull to provide for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but not to bind the Miniſter to live ſo, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe; for though at this time he commanded them to take no ſcrip with them, (that is, no neceſſaries) yet after he ſaith; <hi>But now he that hath a ſcrip let him take it, Luke</hi> 22.36. So likewiſe he willed them to ſalute no man, yet it was not his meaning, that afterwards they ſhould be ſo uncourteous. If this had been a legall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement to the Diſciples, then might they not vary from it, nor live in any other ſort without ſinne. But <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> left this courſe of maintenance and lived upon the labour of their hands, therefore this was no binding commandement, but as a Charter of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty and power granted to the Diſciples. They might both uſe and exact it, if they would, or they might <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedere de jure,</hi> and leave it if they liſted. S. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. largely handleth this point, and concludeth it to the purpoſe we alledge: <hi>So</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Lord ordained that they who preach the Goſpel ſhould live of the Goſpel,</hi> v. 14. <hi>But I</hi> (quoth he) <hi>have uſed none of theſe things,
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:62131:50"/>neither write I theſe things, that it ſhould (thus) be done unto me,</hi> v. 15. By which words, ſaith S. <hi>Auſtin,</hi> it appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth that our Lord commanded not in ſuch ſort, as they which preached the Goſpel,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Tom.</hi> 4.99.</note> might not live otherwiſe then by that that was miniſtred unto them by them to whom they preached it: for then (ſaith he) the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle did againſt this commandement, that got his li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving with the labour of his hands, leſt he ſhould be chargeable to any. But our Lord (ſaith he) gave them power to doe it (if they would) that thereby they might know that theſe things were due unto them. And again, a little after he addeth theſe words; therefore when the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That our Lord ſo ordained, but for his part he uſed it not,</hi> he ſheweth manifeſtly, that power was given them to uſe it, (if they would) but no neceſſity impoſed of doing it, (if they would not.)</p>
               <p>And from this diſtinction is the reconcilement drawn of theſe two places in Scripture, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſeem contrary, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10.10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 9.3. ſay both, that our Lord commanded that the Diſciples ſhould not take, no not a ſtaffe with them: but <hi>Mark</hi> 6.8. re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth it, <hi>Nothing ſave a ſtaffe onely.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Auguſt, de Conſenſ. Eu. Tom. <hi>4.100.</hi>
                  </note> Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> therefore in the firſt place underſtandeth it literally, not ſo much as a ſtaffe to ſtay or uphold them: but in the ſecond place figuratively, for power and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as if the ſpeech had been, Take no kind of neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries with you, no not ſo much as a ſtaffe to ſtay you, ſave onely the ſtaffe of authority that I now give you.</p>
               <p>And in that our Saviour left theſe things to the choice of the Diſciples and Miniſters, he made them Lords and free-men, for neceſſity impoſeth bondage; Therefore <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> ſhewed not onely their freedome in not uſing that that lay in their power, but the noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:62131:51"/>of their mind alſo that would depend upon no bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; and hereby we muſt not judge them to have no right to tithes, becauſe they omitted them alſo.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That many things in the beginning both of the Law and the Goſpel were admitted, or omitted, for the preſent, or refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med afterward.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>AS Painters in the beginning of their work, uſe rude colours, and unperfect lines, for their preſent dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; ſo in all great mutations, many things are for the preſent admitted, or omitted, which future time ſhall have juſt occaſion to reform. This in humane actions is ſo common, as needeth no inſtance: but inſomuch as the holy rites themſelves are not free from it, neither in the old, nor new Teſtament, ir is neceſſary for the point in hand to ſhew ſome examples thereof.</p>
               <p>I obſerve therefore three kinds of alterations, 1. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of things prohibited. 2. Omiſſion of things commanded; and 3. Reformation of things eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>Touching the firſt point; plurality of wives was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden, yet after <hi>Lamech</hi> had broken this inſtitution, the children of God were permitted alſo to doe it. So likewiſe was Divorcement: yet <hi>Moſes</hi> tolerated it.</p>
               <p>None might ſacrifice in the high places, or under green trees, but onely in the Tabernacle, <hi>Deut.</hi> 12.2. yet till the building of the Temple, God often accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted it, as of <hi>Gedeon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prieſts onely might eat the ſhew-bread, yet <hi>David</hi> and his followers did eat it alſo upon neceſſity.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> things commanded were omitted for a time; for when the Law was given, the wheeles
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:62131:51"/>thereof could not preſently fall into their courſe. Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumciſion it ſelf was not uſed during all the 40. years travell in the wilderneſſe, and happily had never been revived, if God had not commanded <hi>Joſhua</hi> to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> the ſecond time, <hi>Joſ.</hi> 5.2. Yea, the great ceremonies of ſacrifices and oblations ſlept all that while, the people offered to Idols, and <hi>Aaron</hi> with them, but from the firſt ſacrifice that <hi>Aaron</hi> offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, at the entring into the wilderneſſe, <hi>Lev.</hi> 9.8. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> not one Altar breathed unto the Lord in 40 years, <hi>Amos</hi> 5.26. Even <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf was buried in this ſleep. How the Paſſeover and other Feaſts were celebrated appeareth not, they are ſeldome mentioned, and may ſeem therefore ſeldome kept. One Paſſeover at the going out of <hi>Aegypt, Exod.</hi> 12.11. Another in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of <hi>Sinai,</hi> God then reviving that commandment, <hi>Numb.</hi> 9.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> After by <hi>Joſhua</hi> at <hi>Gilgal</hi> beyond <hi>Jor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan, Joſ.</hi> 3.10. and from that day till the 18. year of <hi>Joſias,</hi> (that is, above 800. years) all are paſſed over as obſcure, except one in the time of <hi>Solomon,</hi> 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.13. and 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 23.2. But I muſt not conceal that <hi>Moſes</hi> omitteth the Hiſtory of 36. years travail in the wilderneſſe, reporting onely the puniſhment of him that gathered ſticks on the Sabbath day, <hi>Numb.</hi> 15.32. and therefore in that time whether it were kept or not, we can conclude nothing: but it is plain that before <hi>Ezekias</hi> his days it was ſo utterly loſt, that when he came to renue it, it ſeemed meerly a new thing, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29. and all this time alſo, was both the Temple forlorn and ſhut up, and all the holy rites almoſt extinguiſhed till he renued them, <hi>ib.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the point of Reformation; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> the <hi>Levites</hi> were by <hi>Moſes</hi> aſſigned to the Tabernacle; the Prieſts to
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:62131:52"/>the Altar, but both of them confuſedly without diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, and yet ſo they continued till the time of <hi>David:</hi> who to reform this confuſion, divided them into ranks, allotted a part of the ſervice to every rank, and aſſigned to them of the ranks times of attendance, and intermiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 23, 24, 25, 26. <hi>cap.</hi> upon which it is ſaid that <hi>Zacharias</hi> was of the courſe (or rank of <hi>Abia</hi>) and executed the Prieſts office, as his courſe or turn came in order, <hi>Luke</hi> 1.5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 8.</p>
               <p>Some things alſo that were never commanded were brought into the old Law afterward, and well accepted, as the act of faſting, and the habit thereof, ſackcloth and aſhes.</p>
               <p>The brazen Serpent was ſet up by Gods own com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, <hi>Numb.</hi> 21.6. yet when the people burnt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſe to it, <hi>Ezekias</hi> brake it in pieces, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 18.4. without any commandement.</p>
               <p>None might ſlay the burnt-offerings but the Prieſts, but when they were too few, and till more were ſanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the <hi>Levites</hi> did it, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 29.34.</p>
               <p>Likewiſe in the New Teſtament, the wheels of the Goſpel were not by and by in their courſe. The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles themſelves are compelled to the ſame neceſſities.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> to admit many ceremonies aboliſhed, for if they ſtruck at them all at once, they drive all the <hi>Jews</hi> from the doctrine at once; again, if they impoſed them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> the <hi>Gentiles</hi> repined at the burden: to carry the matter therefore as even as they might, they call a Councell, and conſulting upon it, they write to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> that they purpoſed not to burden them but with theſe neceſſary things, <hi>viz.</hi> to abſtain from things offered unto idols, and bloud, and that that is ſtrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, and from fornication, <hi>Acts</hi> 15.29. by which the
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:62131:52"/>
                  <hi>Gentiles</hi> could not complain of being burdened with ceremonies, nor the <hi>Jews</hi> that their ceremonies were contemned. In like ſort Saint <hi>James</hi> and the Elders at Jeruſalem ſeeing many thouſand <hi>Jews</hi> to beleeve, and yet to be zealous of the Law, (<hi>Act.</hi> 21.20.) they not onely tolerated it for the preſent, but perſwaded Saint <hi>Paul</hi> (comming thither) to doe the like, and further to make a ſhew alſo that himſelf obſerved the law: whereupon as before he had circumciſed <hi>Timothy</hi> in ſhew of keeping the law, <hi>Acts</hi> 16.3. ſo now he alſo perſonateth a <hi>Naza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rite,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 6.8.</note> he is purified, and he is ſhaven (as one already) at <hi>Censhrea, Act.</hi> 21.26. and 18.18.</p>
               <p>Thus the Apoſtles applied themſelves to the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the time, the place, and the perſons: thus <hi>Paul</hi> becommeth a <hi>Proteus,</hi> a <hi>Jew</hi> to the <hi>Iews,</hi> a <hi>Gentile</hi> to the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> weak to the weak, all to all, and all this to gain all them to Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 9.22.</p>
               <p>In the mean while, many things required to the eſtabliſhing of the Church, muſt needs be omitted; <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> the main matters they uphold unto death, but the ſeconda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and remote dependances they refer to opportunity: therefore they by and by preſſed no man with keeping the Lords day, and though themſelves began by little and little to ſanctifie it with breaking of bread, and preaching, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. yet the firſt mention of it is above 22. years after the Paſſion of Chriſt in <hi>Acts</hi> 20.7. and I ſuppoſe it to be begun about that time, becauſe I finde that till that time the Apoſtles uſed the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> Sabbath, but never after, through all the New Teſtament; and the reaſon why they then uſed it was, for that the greateſt Aſſemblies being on that day in the Temple and Synagogues of the <hi>Iews,</hi> therefore they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorted thither, there they preached the Goſpel, there
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:62131:53"/>they taught the people, as if themſelves had celebrated that Sabbath. And as it was long ere they brought in the Lords day, ſo in matters more remote and outward, matters belonging to the body, they were leſſe curious; therefore though they laboured hard in the Lords Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, yet they required no wages of any man. And though <hi>Paul</hi> preſcribed that Biſhops ſhould be good houſekeepers, yet few or none of them were owners of houſes, but rather as fugitives to eſcape perſecution, or as pilgrims to preach the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>If the law that was given in a ſolitary place, <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> to a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſequeſtred from all other, and at union amongſt themſelves, and having no publique nor potent adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to hinder the courſe thereof; if they I ſay, could not preſerve it in the originall integrity, much more of neceſſity muſt the eſtabliſhment of the Goſpel be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached and turned out of the courſe thereof, it riſing in the midſt of the enemies, in the flame of perſecution, and with the oppoſition of the greateſt Potentates in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Region. It muſt therefore have the greater need of ſundry Reformations: ſome of the firſt lineaments muſt be wiped out, ſome altered, &amp; ſome as occaſion ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved muſt be added or amended; the <hi>Iudaicall</hi> ceremonies that for many years together were permitted in the cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle time of the Church, muſt be taken away: <hi>Paul</hi> that then ſuffered them, now ſuppreſſeth them, <hi>Col.</hi> 3. <hi>Gal.</hi> 3. <hi>ca.</hi> 4. <hi>c.</hi> 5. and the holy Ghoſt throughout all the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> beateth them down for ever.</p>
               <p>Thus as old branches be cut off, ſo ſome new be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graffed; the Lords day, the Feaſts of <hi>Eaſter</hi> and <hi>Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſontide,</hi> not ſpoken of in the beginning, are brought in at length. Deacons are ordained preſently after Chriſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 6.2. but no Biſhops in 20. years after, nor were
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:62131:53"/>they then particularly aſcribed every one to his limit, but many together over one City, as at <hi>Epheſus, Act.</hi> 20.28. So women at firſt were admitted to be Deacons,<note place="margin">Conc. Laodicen. c. <hi>11.</hi>
                  </note> but time afterwards wore them out. Chriſt commanded his Diſciples that they ſhould not goe from houſe to houſe, but <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, I have taught you openly, and from houſe to houſe, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.20.</p>
               <p>To conclude, all could not be ſuddainly done, nor compendiouſly written, that belonged to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church, therefore the Apoſtles left much to the wiſedome of the Church, under this generall Commiſſion, <hi>Let all be done in order,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 14.40. a few words, but of great extent, like that of the Dictators at <hi>Rome,</hi> which being but two words, <hi>providere reipub:</hi> gave them authority over every thing.</p>

                  </note> God ſtrictly exacted not theſe things till the place he had cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen was prepared for them, that is, till the building of the Temple; as it is true in part touching the old Law, ſo is it like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe true in the new Law: and that therefore Chriſt and the Apoſtles exacted not the payment of Tithes in the firſt pilgrimage and warfare of the Goſpel, but referred them amongſt ſome other things till the Church were eſtabliſhed; for as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every thing hath his time, and the time was not yet come,</hi> that the Church ſhould demand her owne, leſt with <hi>Martha,</hi> ſhee ſeemed curious about worldly things, rather then as <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> to ſeek the ſpirituall.</p>
               <p>When the Kindome was rent from <hi>Saul</hi> and given to <hi>David, David</hi> by and by ſought not the Crown, but life and liberty: ſo the Prieſthood being rent from <hi>Levi</hi> and given to the Church, the Church by and by required not her earthly duties, but as <hi>David</hi> did life to grow up, and liberty to ſpread abroad; for love (ſaith Saint <hi>Paul</hi>) ſeeketh not her own, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.5. and ſhould then the mother of all love (the Church) be curious herein, eſpecially when her neceſſities were otherwiſe ſo abundantly ſupplied?</p>
               <p>Saint <hi>Paul</hi> maketh it manifeſt (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. throughout) where he ſheweth, that very much liberty, and great matters were due unto him in reſpect of his Miniſtry, yet he concludeth, I have not uſed this power (<gap reason="foreign">

Yet the truth is, that the letter <hi>X</hi> thus uſed for the name of Chriſt, is no Latine letter, but borrowed from the Greek, where it ſignifieth <hi>Ch,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it repreſents not onely the name, but the Croſſe of Chriſt, in which the Latin letter <hi>X,</hi> as the number and character of ten, hath alſo much hieroglyphicall ſignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To come to the <hi>Arithmeticall</hi> figures that expreſſe it, which are the figure of 1, and the cypher ο, 1 ſignifieth the ſame that <hi>Alpha</hi> doth in Greek, that is, one.

But as the cypher ο, in this reſpect ſignifieth the end, ſo we muſt mark that it is a circle, and hath no end. Being therefore joyned to the figure of 1, which ſignifieth the beginning, it ſheweth unto us,
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:62131:61"/>that the beginning is without end, &amp; the end it ſelf with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out beginning or end, both infinite &amp; without any limit.

               <p>The ſame Father yet further ſaith, that the number of 10. ſignifieth the Law of God, <hi>Quia in decem praeceptis lex data eſt.</hi> And in another place, <hi>Denarius legem (ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificat) undonarius peccatum: quia tranſgreſsio eſt dena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rii</hi> 1. The number of 10. ſignifieth the Law, and for that the number of 11. exceedeth it, the number of 11. ſignifieth ſin.

               <p>That God accepted the tithe, or tenth, as, and for the whole of that whereof it is yeelded, is apparent by Gods own expoſition, for when he had reſerved it to himſelf, as his rent out of the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> given by him to the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and aſſigned that rent over to the <hi>Levites</hi> for their maintenance, yet out of that aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignment, he reſerved alſo a tithe, or tenth part, to be laid up in the chambers of the treaſure houſe, to be offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to himſelf, as it were thereby to hold his poſſeſſion, and to keep ſeiſin of his inheritance, which in the 18. of <hi>Num.</hi> 20. is called an heave-offering: and this very heave-offering, which was as I ſay, but the tenth part of the tenth, that is, the 100. part of the whole, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:62131:62"/>and taken by God, as the full ſeiſin and ſatisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction for the whole; therefore he biddeth <hi>Moſes</hi> ſay to the <hi>Levites,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Numb. 18.27.</note> —<hi>Your heave-offering ſhall be reckoned unto you as the corn of the barn, or as the abundance of the wine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſe:</hi> that is, the tithe that you are to give, though it be the hundreth part, yet I will accept of it, as if it were all the corn of your barn, and of your fields, and as the whole profits, even as the abundance of your Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards. In like manner alſo doth he accept the fat of ſuch offerings, in the 29. <hi>v.</hi> to ſhew unto us, that ſince all is his, he will have perpetuall ſeiſin of the whole, and will not be diſinherited of the leaſt part.</p>
               <p>Doubtleſſe he is well pleaſed with this tenth part, for when he threatned the deſtruction of the Land by <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> he concludeth, yet there ſhall be a tenth part re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining as to repleniſh it again, and as holy ſeed, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.13. he will ſave his own part.

               <p>And this obſervation amongſt the Ancients hath been ſo notorious and remarkable, that they commonly uſed the word tenth in Latine, <hi>decimus, decumanus &amp; decimanus,</hi> to expreſſe the greateſt things; therefore in the diviſion of their fields, they called the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, <hi>decumanum limitem;</hi> the greateſt or chief gate in their Camp, <hi>decumanam portam;</hi> the greateſt ſhields, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumana ſcuta;</hi> and ſo likewiſe, <hi>decumanos fluctus,</hi> and <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumanaova, decumanu<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> acipenſerem:</hi>

And becauſe in the procreation of men, and many other living creatures, the number of 10. is moſt happy and effectuall, as the tenth month in ſome, and the tenth week in others; the <hi>Romanes</hi> admired the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret vertues of this number ſo ſuperſtitiouſly, as they canonized it among their gods by the name of <hi>Decu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma,</hi> as you may read in <hi>Tertullian, Gellius,</hi> and many o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

<pb n="78" facs="tcp:62131:64"/>for that purpoſe, but for the gueſts and offerings alſo whatſoever dedicated and given to God: and I find that of this Treaſury there were 3. ſorts: <hi>Meſack,</hi> where the munificent gifts of Kings and Princes were laid up: <hi>Corban,</hi> where thoſe of the Prieſts: and <hi>Gazophylacium,</hi> whereinto the people and all paſſengers brought their offerings, and into which the poor widow, as it ſeemeth, caſt her two mites. I find not any particular limitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe Treaſuries, but the common end of them all was to be employed upon things neceſſary for the houſe and ſervice of God, and for relief of the poor, and of orphans,<note place="margin">Antiq.

This upholdeth the cuſtome of many places of <hi>England,</hi> where the very ſervants pay a tithe out of their wages, ſome deduction being made for appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell: and by like reaſon I think, that thoſe that have Annuities and fees, as Officers and ſuch like, ought to yeeld a tithe thereof; for out of thoſe the King hath his Subſidies and tenths, and by like, yea better reaſon ſhould God have his portion: <hi>Of all that thou ſhalt give me,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jacob, will I give the tenth unto thee;</hi> and in the Goſpel, the <hi>Phariſee,</hi> though braggingly, yet accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the uſe of the righteous of that time, ſaith, <hi>I give tithe of all that I poſſeſſe;</hi> as it ſeemeth, even of his goods, and dead commodities, as of the fruits of the earth.

In the 31. of the 2 <hi>Chron. v.</hi> 6. it is ſaid, They brought the tithes <hi>Boum &amp; pecudum,</hi> of oxen and ſheep, things tithed before whileſt they were
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:62131:65"/>young, as I conceive, and not now again to bee tithed, when they were grown to their full ages. So in the 10. of <hi>Nehe.</hi> 37. they brought firſt-fruits of their dough, yet no doubt, their dough was tithed before in the corn it was made of: therefore I take theſe tithes to be tithes <hi>ad placitum,</hi> in the election of the party, whether he will give them or not; but if he doe allot them to God, he is tyed like <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Sapphira</hi> to perform them faithfully, for they then become due <hi>ex praecepto;</hi> for he that voweth unto the Lord, is commanded not to break his promiſe, <hi>Numb.</hi> 30.3.

                  <p>That things offered to God be holy.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>I Muſt firſt explain what I mean by holy, and that is, not that they are divine things, or like thoſe of the Sanctuary, which none might touch ſave the anointed Prieſts. But like the lands and poſſeſſions of the <hi>Levites</hi> mentioned in <hi>Leviticus,—that were ſaid to be holy and ſeparate from common uſe, and ſeparate from man, Levit.</hi> 27.28, 29. that is, from the injury of ſecular perſons, and to be onely diſpoſed to and for the ſervice and ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of God, <hi>defenſum &amp; munitum ab injuria hominum, N. F. de rer. diviſ. L. ſanctum,</hi> as the perſons of Emperors and Kings are ſaid to be holy and ſacred: for as the Altar ſanctifieth the offering, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.19. ſo theſe things being offered to God, are by this very act of oblation made holy, and taken ſo into his own tuition, as they may not after be divorced. Wo be therfore to the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> that devour widows houſes, <hi>Mat.</hi> 23.14. how much more wo then unto thoſe that deſtroy the houſe of God, and by divorcing Chriſt from his Spouſe the Church, make him alſo a widower, and his Church
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:62131:66"/>a widow, and ſo devour both the widows houſe, and the widow her ſelf.</p>
               <p>But ſome are of opinion, that the Church it ſelfe is no longer holy, then while the ſervice of God is in hand therein: as the Mount and the Buſh were no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger holy then while God was there: and by that reaſon a Church and an Ale-houſe are of like ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctity, for a man may preach in an Ale-houſe, and mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter the Sacraments in an Ale-houſe, and occaſion ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doth neceſſarily require it: And what is their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hereof? why, their reaſon is, that conſectation of places, and of the implements belonging to the ſervice of God were <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies, and therefore end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law. Theſe men reaſon, as if be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law there had been no rules of Gods honour: and as though the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, and the Law of nature taught us nothing therein: Doth not God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf leave the precepts of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon with the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> out of the Law of nature, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3. when he ſaith, <hi>will any man ſpoil his goddeſſe?</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, that the Law of nature hath ſanctified thoſe things that are offered unto God, and therefore will any man violate the Law of nature? Doth not Saint <hi>Paul</hi> reaſon alſo in the ſame ſort, when he ſaith, Deſpiſe ye the Church of God? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. If I ſhould apply the places of Scripture that are ſpoken of the great reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the Temple, it would be ſaid, that that were <hi>Leviticall:</hi> but the office of the Temple was <hi>Morall,</hi> as well as <hi>Leviticall,</hi> and therefore though theſe be ended, yet the other, the <hi>Morall</hi> remaineth.</p>
               <p>When Chriſt had caſt the oxen &amp; doves that were for the <hi>Leviticall</hi> ſervice out of the Temple, yet he ſaid, that it was an houſe of Prayer, as figurating that after the ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:62131:67"/>were ended and gone, yet the <hi>Morall</hi> office of the Temple to be an houſe of Prayer ſtill remained. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.22. when he ſaith, <hi>Deſpiſe yee the Church of God?</hi> ſpeaking it as if he wondred that any ſhould be ſo irreligious, or rather ſacrilegious to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſe the Church; and no man I think doubteth but that this was ſpoken of the materiall Church, for he blameth them that did uſe unſeemly drinking in the Church.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>That the Tradition of ancient Fathers and Councels is not lightly to be regarded.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>IT appeareth by divers ancient Fathers and Councels, that Tithes were paid long before their times in the Primitive Church, and were unto the age of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, though little memory thereof remaineth in the Authors of thoſe times. And ſhall we not beleeve the Fathers received ſuch inſtruction from their el<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders? Doth not God bid us ask after the days of old, and the years of ſo many generations, ſaying, <hi>Ask thy father, and he will ſhew thee; thine elders, and they will tell thee?</hi> Deut. 32.7. If we ſhall not beleeve them, why ſhould we ask them? and why did the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> complain, that their Fathers heard not the words of the book of the Law, 2 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.13. but
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:62131:68"/>becauſe they therefore could not report it to them their children?</p>
               <p>Shall we think nothing to be done, but what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? doth not the Evangeliſt tell us, that if all were written that Chriſt did, he ſuppoſed the world could not contain the books, <hi>Joh.</hi> 21.25? are not many acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of elder time alledged in latter Scriptures, and yet no teſtimony of them in the former? it is ſaid, 1 <hi>Chro.</hi> 26.18. that <hi>Samuel, Abner,</hi> and <hi>Joab,</hi> dedicated many things unto God, yet their ſtory reporteth no ſuch matter. <hi>Solomon</hi> is noted, 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 10. to have kept a famous Paſſeover: yet is there not a word of it in the hiſtory of his time. Faſting was brought into the Church before Chriſt, and the uſe alſo of building of Synagogues, but it appeareth not when, or how. <hi>Paul</hi> alledgeth, that our Saviour ſaid, It is better to give, then to take, <hi>Act.</hi> 20.35. yet no Evangeliſt doth men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it. <hi>Jude</hi> ſaith, <hi>v.</hi> 9. <hi>that</hi> Michael <hi>and the Devil ſtrove for the body of</hi> Moſes, yet the Old Teſtament noteth no ſuch thing; how then came they by theſe inſtructions? Surely by books that are periſhed, or by inſpiration, or by relation of others: and doubtleſſe the ancient Fathers came to the knowledge of many things by all theſe ways. Firſt, by books that be periſhed, for it is manifeſt by <hi>Euſebius, Jerome, Gennadius,</hi> and others, that the ancient Fathers ſaw many thouſands, which are not now extant. If by inſpiration, the holy Ghoſt, that was ſent down upon the Apoſtles, and paſſed from one to another, returned not by and by to heaven, but remained actually amongſt the Fathers of the Primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Church; and therefore what they generally taught is carefully to be kept. But if they received theſe things by Tradition, the very Tradition of thoſe firſt
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:62131:69"/>ages of the Church are much to be received; for all that time, no doubt, infinite ſpeeches and actions of Chriſt and the Apoſtles (whereof many were collected by <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natius</hi> and <hi>Papias,</hi> as <hi>Jerome</hi> reporteth, but now loſt) were then freſh in the mouths of every man, as not onely the Fathers of that time doe abundantly teſtifie, but our own experience alſo induceth us to conceive; for doe not we our ſelves hear and beleeve many things to be done in the time of King <hi>Hen.</hi> 8. that never yet were written, nor like to be?</p>

                  <p>Ancient Councels and Canons for payment of Tithes.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>THe Canons attributed to the Apoſtles, come firſt in rank to be mentioned, yet I will not inſiſt upon them. Neither doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> (as they are now publiſhed) maintain them to be the children of thoſe Fathers. Yet can it not be denyed that the firſt 35. of them are very ancient and neer the time of the Apoſtles; for <hi>Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius Exigu.</hi> that lived within 400. yeares of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, tranſlated them out of Greek as received long before in the Eaſtern Church.</p>
               <p>The fifth of thoſe Canons ordaineth, that all other fruit ſhould be ſent as firſt-fruit (and tithe) home to the houſe of the Biſhop and Prieſts, and not to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered upon the Altar; adding further, that it was ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt that the Biſhops and Prieſts did divide it to the Deacons, and the reſt of the Clerks. And though the Greek copy in this place, calleth not theſe fruits <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, Tithes, yet the Canon ſeemeth to bee meant thereof, for other fruit none was to be carried to the houſe of the Biſhop, or to bee divided amongſt the
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:62131:69"/>Prieſts, and the Deacons, ſave offerings, tithes, and firſt-fruits; therefore the old Tranſlation of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nons out of <hi>Zonaras,</hi> expreſſeth it tithe and firſt-fruits. And this faſhion here received of ſending theſe things to the houſe of the Biſhop, and his dividing of them among the Prieſts and Deacons, ſheweth the great an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquity of this Canon; for it appeareth, that the firſt uſage was ſo, and that the Miniſters had <hi>menſtruam ſpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tulam,</hi> every month a basket of the offerings and tithes for their maintenance, whereupon they were called <hi>Clerici ſportulantes, i.</hi> basket Clerks.</p>

<pb n="92" facs="tcp:62131:71"/>exhibit. The Councell proceedeth further, ſhewing reaſons why Tithes ſhould be paid. That if the <hi>Jews</hi> were ſo carefull inexecuting this commandement, as they would not omit it in the leaſt things, mint, and rue, &amp;c. as our Saviour teſtifieth; how much more ought the people of the Goſpel to perform it, that hath a greater number of Prieſts, and a more ſincere manner of Sacraments?

               </argument>
               <p>WE have ſaid in our definition, that they be due unto God: now we are to ſhew by what right, and to prove it. Firſt, therefore, I divide Tithes into two ſorts, Morall, and Leviticall; Morall, are thoſe which were due to God before the Law given in the time of nature. Leviticall, are thoſe nine parts aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by God himſelf, (upon giving the Law) unto the <hi>Levites</hi> for their maintenance, the tenth part being ſtill reſerved to himſelf, and retained in his own hands. Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall tithes were paid by man unto God, <hi>abſque praecep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to,</hi> without any commandement; Leviticall tithes were paid by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> unto the <hi>Levites,</hi> as tranſacted and ſet over by God unto them <hi>pro tempore</hi> for the time being, and that by an expreſſe Canon of the Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall law. To ſpeak in the phraſe of Lawyers, and to make a caſe of it; God is originally ſeiſed of tithes to his own uſe, <hi>in dominico ſuo, ut de feodo,</hi> in his own demeſne, as of fee-ſimple, or as I may ſay, <hi>Jure Coronae,</hi> and being ſo ſeiſed by his Charter dated, <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <p>But we muſt prove the parts of the caſe: and firſt, the title, namely, that he was ſeiſed in fee of originall Tithes, that is, that originall Tithes doe for ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him. Hear the evidence: which I will divide into three parts, as grounding it firſt upon the law of Nature; ſecondly, upon the Law of God; and thirdly, upon the Law of Nations.</p>

<pb n="96" facs="tcp:62131:73"/>bear unto himſelf. Some are of opinion that they learned much of this from the children of God.

               <p>I Would not be ſo curious as to ſeek the inſtitution of tithes in Paradiſe: yet no man will deny but that Paradiſe was a modell of the Church, and that God had his honourary rights in all the three kindes, he now requireth them at our hands, namely, a portion of time, place, and of the fruits; of the fruits, as the tree of knowledge; of the place, as the midſt of the Garden; the time, as the cool of the day, which ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifieth the time of reſt, and ſo the Lords day: as more
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:62131:74"/>particularly wee ſhall ſhew by and by. Touching the fruit, it was the portion that God reſerved from <hi>Adam</hi> when he gave him all the reſt; and that portion alſo that juſtly and properly belongeth to God, knowledge. And therefore this part particularly was aſſigned by God unto his Prieſts, as the ſacred keepers of this his ſacred Treaſure, and therefore no other man might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade this his right and inheritance, Knowledge (ſaith <hi>Malachi</hi>) belongeth to the Prieſt. Touching place, what ſhould be aſſigned to the chiefeſt, but the chie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt? and what is the beſt and chiefeſt, but the midſt? for <hi>medium</hi>—and therefore the place here where Gods portion is aſſigned him, is the midſt of the Garden; and therefore into this place doth <hi>Adam</hi> flye as into Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary, and to the horns of the Altar, when he had offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, for it is ſaid, that <hi>Adam</hi> hid himſelf in the midſt of the Garden: So <hi>Calvin,</hi> which is, the trees in the midſt of the Garden.</p>
               <p>And touching the time, it is by all expoſitors upon the matter, applied to the time of reſt: for either they expound the cool of the day to be the evening, as <hi>Onca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus,</hi> or the morning, as <hi>Calvin;</hi> and take it in either of theſe ſenſes, it may aptly diſcover the <hi>Judaicall</hi> Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath in the firſt ſenſe, or the <hi>Chriſtians</hi> Sabbath in the latter. And as theſe are the times when we are to make our publick reckonings, confeſſions, and prayers unto God, and thereupon to receive ſentence of curſe or abſolution: ſo at this time, preſently God calleth <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eve,</hi> and the Serpent, that is, the whole congregation of Paradiſe to a publique recko<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, confeſſion, and account; and like the great Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary and Biſhop of his Church, denounceth againſt them the curſe that their ſins had demerited.</p>
               <pb n="99" facs="tcp:62131:74"/>
               <p>If occaſion required, I could ſhew many other par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars wherein Paradiſe exemplified the very Church of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Again, theſe rights of honour are likewiſe prefigu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red unto us in other examples, under the age of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, the time I mean before the floud: for we have therein three great examples of all theſe his three rights. Firſt, in the creation of the earth he reſerved a particular place for himſelf as the place of his own reſort and pleaſure, Paradiſe; which was the very lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call place of his Church, and therefore out thereof he threw man, being accurſed as a prophane and excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate perſon. And as touching his portion of time, he figuratively ſhewed the ſeventh part of our age to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto him, as in reſpect of his Sabbath, when he took <hi>Enoch,</hi> being the ſeventh from <hi>Adam,</hi> to keep his perpetuall Sabbath.</p>
               <p>And ſo likewiſe all the fruits of the tenth age, which was that of <hi>Noah</hi> (for he was the tenth from <hi>Adam</hi>) he took wholly to himſelf: making the evill parts as a ſacrifice of his wrath, to honour him by their deſtruction, and the better parts, which were ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the Ark of his Church, to glorifie his name by their preſervation: ſo that in this time of nature, the full tenth of all things was paid unto God as a propi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiatory ſacrifice, for of the ten ages from <hi>Adam</hi> hee had the fruits of one whole age, which is all one as if he had had the tenth part of every particular thing as it grew due in every particular age, and ſo the Church expoundeth in that Canon of the Councell of <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">

               <argument>
                  <p>The time of Nature, after the fall.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>LEt us take a view of the ſtate of Religion before the Law, and from thence unto the calling of the <hi>Levites</hi> to the ſervice of the Tabernacle. The time before the Law was the kingdome of ſin and of death, having no means propounded whereby to eſcape, but what the light and law of nature taught unto men, who finding themſelves fallen from the favour de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed by invocation and beating of the heavens, with continuall odours and ſavours to ſeek for mercy at Gods hand, and by ſacrificing of bullocks and brute beaſts to ranſome themſelves as far as they might from his heavy diſpleaſure. Therefore in thoſe times though every man might offer oblations and ſacrifices that would, yet becauſe the order thereof might bee the more certain and reverent, both the children of God, and the Heathen alſo, ordained to themſelves particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar perſons of greateſt worth, wiſdome, and ſanctity, which they called their Prieſts to take care of theſe things, to ſee them performed in ſuch manner as might make them moſt acceptable to God. Hereby grew the reputation of Prieſthood to be above all dignities, that in thoſe days the Kings themſelves in all Nations af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it as the greateſt and immediate honour under God himſelf. Yet becauſe neceſſity required ſo great a number of Prieſts for the ſervice of God, as there could not be had Kings enough for that purpoſe, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore other inferiour perſons were alſo called to that excellent function; yet ſuch as in one reſpect or other were ſtill the nobleſt that were to be found. Therefore
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:62131:75"/>even in that time (I mean before the Law was given) God promiſeth the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> that if they will hear his voice indeed, and keep his covenant, they ſhall not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be his chiefeſt treaſure upon earth, but they ſhall be unto him alſo a kingdome of Prieſts, <hi>Exod.</hi> 29.5, <hi>&amp;</hi> 6.</p>
               <p>Of theſe kingly Prieſts, two are mentioned in Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture before the Law; <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> Prieſt and King of <hi>Salem,</hi> and <hi>Revel</hi> or <hi>Jethro,</hi> Prince and Prieſt of <hi>Midian.</hi>

                  </note> Of other Prieſts it appeareth in <hi>Exod.</hi> 19.22. <hi>&amp;</hi> 24. that there were many. <hi>Let the Prieſts</hi> (ſaith God) <hi>that come to the Lord be ſanctified;</hi> and again, <hi>Let not the Prieſts break their bounds, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Touching theſe Prieſts we finde no mention either how they were called to their function, or how they were maintained in it; neither of them that executed that place after the Law was given till the calling of the <hi>Levites,</hi> which though it were a ſhort time, as not above a year and ſome months, yet muſt they have ſome maintenance and means to live on even during that time. The Prieſts of <hi>Aegypt</hi> had not onely lands for their maintenance, but they alſo had a certain part appointed them by <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to live upon; and though it appeareth not by the Scripture what this part was, yet it is plain, that it was ſuch, and ſo bountifull, as when all the other <hi>Egyptians</hi> ſold their land to <hi>Joſeph</hi> for <hi>Pharaoh</hi> to ſave their lives in the famine, they li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved upon this part and kept their lands.</p>
               <p>The children of God (no doubt) came not behinde the Heathen in devotion, and conſequently not in their bounty to their Prieſts; therefore though we have no authority to demonſtrate unto us the particular means wherein they were provided for, before the Law, yet
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:62131:76"/>we may very probably conceive it to be much after the manner of the Heathen Prieſts of that time, for that the Prieſts and children of God being then ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered amongſt the Heathen, as <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> among the <hi>Canaanites, Jethro</hi> amongſt the <hi>Midianites,</hi> could uſe no rites nor ceremonies in the worſhip of the true God, but the Heathen would have the ſame in the ſervice of their gods: inſomuch as nothing is mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in the Scripture concerning the ſame before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Inſtitutions, but it is particularly found a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the <hi>Gentiles</hi> firſt, touching both their Prieſts and manner of ſanctifying of them, as alſo touching their offerings, altars, and ſacrifices, and the manner of fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſting at the ſacrifice of thankſgiving uſed by <hi>Jethro, Exod.</hi> 18.12.</p>
               <p>I infer therefore, that ſeeing the Heathen took their originall manner of holy rites from the children of God, that therefore what originall rites the Heathen had in their ſervice of their religion, that the ſame were in uſe alſo among the children of God, though they be not mentioned in the Scripture: and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, that inſomuch as the Heathen univerſally paid Tithes and firſt-fruits unto their Gods and Prieſts, that therefore the children of God did ſo likewiſe from the beginning to the true God. And to this agreeth <hi>Hugo Cardinalis,</hi> ſaying, It is thought that <hi>Adam</hi> taught his ſons to offer firſt-fruits and tenths unto God: ſo that the children of God borrowed it not from the Heathen, or the Heathen from them, but both the one and the other from the law of nature; for as <hi>Ambroſe</hi> ſaith, God therefore by <hi>Moſes</hi> followed not the faſhion of the <hi>Gentiles: Non ergo Deus per Moſem Gentilium for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam ſequutus eſt; ſed ipſa naturalis ratio hoc habet, ut
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:62131:76"/>quis inde vivat ubi laborat,</hi> in Epiſt. 1 Cor. ca. 9. C. 41. Col. c.</p>
               <p>And as the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> do plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly confirm it to be done by them, ſo doubtleſſe was it alſo done by other of the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> even before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Inſtitutions, and even then holden and taken to be a duty belonging unto God, as plainly appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth by Gods own mouth in 22. <hi>Exod.</hi> 29. when hee ſaith, and that before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Inſtitutions: <hi>Thine abundance and thy liquor ſhalt thou not keep back:</hi> which all Interpreters agree to be ſpoken of the Tithe and firſt-fruits of corn, oyl, and wine, and therefore <hi>Jerome</hi> doubted not ſo to tranſlate it, <hi>viz. Thy tithes and firſt-fruits ſhalt thou not keep back:</hi> wherein the word keep back, <hi>non tardabis,</hi> is very materially to be conſidered, as evidently ſhewing, that it was a cuſtome of old to pay theſe tithes unto the Lord, and therefore that he now required them not as a new thing, but as due un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by an ancient uſage. That the word <hi>non tardabis,</hi> thou ſhalt not keep back, or delay, implieth a thing formerly due, very reaſon telleth us, and the uſe of it in other parts of Scripture doth confirm it, for the very ſame word <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>This is the firſt place in Scripture wherein tithes be
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:62131:79"/>mentioned, therefore ſome may think it the firſt time they were paid, but that is no argument; for ſo it is the firſt place where a Prieſt is mentioned, yet no doubt Prieſts were before. <hi>Noah</hi> performed the Prieſts office when he built an Altar,<note place="margin">No fiſh, as though the curſe extended not to the ſea.</note> and offered of every cleane beaſt, and fowl upon it, <hi>Gen.</hi> 8.20. And it is very likely that <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> himſelf had borne the office of a Prieſt many hundred years before he met <hi>Abraham,</hi> though the Scripture doth not mention him till the meeting; for if it be lawfull to enquire of that the holy Ghoſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealeth not, many great Divines are of opinion, that he was <hi>Sem</hi> the ſon of <hi>Noah;</hi> (whom the <hi>Salemites</hi> had made their King) and it may well be, for it appeareth in <hi>Gen.</hi> 11. that <hi>Sem</hi> lived 600. years, whereof 502. after the Floud, and of them 209. in the life of <hi>Abraham:</hi> So that to thoſe of that new world that <hi>Abraham</hi> lived in, (I mean after the Floud) he might well ſeem without father or mother, or any beginning, being born almoſt 100. years before the Floud, and to have been a Prieſt for ever. And then in like conſequence he might have received tithes of divers other before he thus met <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham:</hi> for that uſe was common long before among the Heathen, and likely it is, that the Heathen rather learned it of the children of God, then that the children of God ſhould learn it of them, as <hi>Hemmingius</hi> would have it, who ſaith, that <hi>Abraham</hi> gave theſe tithes of his own accord, following therein (without all doubt) the manner of Conquerors, which were wont to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrate the tithe of the ſpoil unto their gods, or to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow it upon their Prieſts.

Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith, the Chriſtians doe keep it ſpiritually, ſo that if tithe be not given in the tenth, according to the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Inſtitution, yet the ſpirituall meaning of providing for the Clergy our <hi>Levites</hi> remaineth. But with the precepts of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> and <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> Laws divers rules of the <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall</hi> Law are alſo mingled: as the Laws againſt Witch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es,<note place="margin">Not to reap every corner of our field, nor to gather our fruit clean: not to keep the pledge that belongeth to the perſon of our brother.</note> Uſerers, Oppreſſors, &amp;c. the Laws that command us to lend to our brother without intereſt, and to ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctifie the Sabbath; for though the Inſtitution of the Sabbath be changed, yet the ſpirituall obſervation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth, and that not onely in the manner of ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, but as touching the time alſo, even the ſeventh day. Notwithſtanding I find not, that the Apoſtles commanded us to change it, but becauſe they did change it, we take their practice to be as a Law unto us: yet though they changed the time, they altered not the number, that is, the ſeventh day. I will then reaſon that God hath as good right to our goods of the world, as to the days of our life: and that a part of them belong unto him, as well as the other. And the action of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob</hi> may as well be a prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to us for the one, (in what proportion we are to render them) as that of the Apoſtles in the other; for
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:62131:81"/>both of them were out of the Law, the one after it, the other before it: And why may not the limitation of the day appointed to the Lord for his Sabbath be altered and changed, as well as the portion appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to him for the tenth? You will ſay, the ſeventh day was not due to him by the law of nature, for then <hi>Abraham</hi> and the Fathers ſhould have kept it before the Law given, but it held the fitteſt analogy to that naturall duty, that we owe to the ſervice of God; and therefore when that portion of time was once particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly choſen by God for his ſervice, by reaſon himſelf had commanded it under the Law, the Apoſtles, after the Law was aboliſhed, retained it in the Goſpel: And ſo ſince the number of the tenth was both given to God before the Law, and required by him in the time of the Law, being alſo moſt conſonant to all other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, great reaſon it is to hold it in the age of the Goſpel. Yet with this difference, that in the old Law the Sabbath was the laſt part of the ſeven days, and in the Goſpel it is the firſt, becauſe our Saviour roſe from the dead the firſt day of the week, and not the ſeventh.</p>
               <p>God is our Lord, and we owe him both rent and ſervice: our ſervice is appointed to bee due every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth day, our rent to be the tenth part of our encreaſe. He dealeth not like the hard Landlords, that will have their rent though their Tenants bee loſers by their Land, but he requireth nothing ſave out of their gain, and but the tenth part thereof onely. Theſe two re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions of rendring him the ſeventh day of our life, and the tenth part of our goods, are a plain demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to us, of our ſpirituall and temporall duty to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God. Spiritually, in keeping the Sabbath, and temporally, in payment of tithes, that is, in providing
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:62131:81"/>for his Miniſtery, and them in neceſſity; the one be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the image of our faith, the other of our works: for ſeven is the number of ſpirituall ſanctification, ten the number of legall juſtification. Therefore to pay all the nine parts was nothing, if we failed in the tenth; for the tenth is the number of perfection, and therefore re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired above all other as the type of legall juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. And as our faith is nothing without works, ſo neither is the Sabbath without tithes: for they that miniſter to us the ſpirituall bleſſings of the Sabbath, muſt receive from us the temporall gratuities of Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing.</p>

                  <p>Beſides the practice of the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Graecians,</hi> other barbarous Nations did obſerve the Law of Tithing: For in the remains of naturall underſtanding &amp; notions, the <hi>Barbarians</hi> had a part as wel, &amp; often a greater part then the <hi>Graecians</hi> or <hi>Romans</hi> more civillized Nations had; and commonly the ancienteſt cuſtomes are to be found amongſt the <hi>Barbarians,</hi> and not among the <hi>Graecians,</hi> nor <hi>Romans,</hi> as common experience obſerveth. The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſent the Tithes of their <hi>Sicilian</hi> ſpoils unto <hi>Hercules</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> for <hi>Hercu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les</hi> was the chief Patron and Protector of <hi>Tyre,</hi> and the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> were a <hi>Tyrian</hi> Colony. Nor did they ſend their Tithe once, or ſometime, or as they would, out of ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary devotion, but of ancient and ordinary cuſtome, as <hi>Diodorus Siculus</hi> reporteth; which growing into diſuſe, through negligence and diſregard in long tract of time, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny dyſaſters in war, and other croſſes in affairs of State be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fell them. And thereupon to reconcile themſelves, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſe <hi>Hercules,</hi> they renued again the forgotten cuſtome, and ſent thither not only the Tithe of the ſpoils, but of all things encreaſing and renuing yearly. Thus much is reported by
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:62131:88"/>
                     <hi>Diodorus,</hi> where he relateth into what ſtraits the <hi>Cartha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginians</hi> were driven, and into how many hard aſſays, by <hi>Agathocles</hi> the <hi>Scicilian.</hi> It is a memorable place for ſuch piety; therefore it ſhall be here recited.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Carthaginians</hi> ſuppoſing that theſe loſſes and dyſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters were ſent unto them of God, betooke themſelves to all manner ſupplication and devotion; and for ſo much as they ſuppoſed <hi>Hercules</hi> eſpecially to be angry with them, who was chiefly worſhipped at <hi>Tyrus,</hi> from whence origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally they were extracted, they ſent exceeding great pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents and rich gifts thither. Being thence deſcended they were accuſtomed in former times to ſend unto <hi>Tyre</hi> the tenth for <hi>Hercules,</hi> of all their Revenues and encreaſe, any way renuing, iſſuing or growing; but becomming in proceſſe of time very wealthy, and having exceeding great commings in, they ſent very ſeldome their Tithe, and that but ſmall and refuſe, unto <hi>Tyre,</hi> in neglect and diſregard of the Deity. But upon this great loſſe, comming home to themſelves, and repenting of their irreligion, they became mindfull of the Gods, all that were worſhipped at <hi>Tyre,</hi> and ſent unto them the tenth.</p>
                  <p>Altogether as we uſe to ſerve God. <hi>Phryx plagis.</hi> Iſra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el when God ſmote them, then they repented, returned, and honoured him: but when he turned his hand, they turned their hearts. So the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> being plagued firſt, returned unto their former cuſtome, (an ancient cuſtome beyond the memory of man, and yearly, not ſometime) and gave willingly in abundance their tenth part of all their commings in: not ſo much but of their children they gave the tenth, for they uſed to ſacrifice them unto <hi>Saturn,</hi> as <hi>Iſrael</hi> did in the Valley of <hi>Hinnom.</hi> Old Father <hi>Ennius</hi> remembreth this cuſtome, <hi>Poeni ſos ſolitei ſont ſacrifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re puellos:</hi> which cuſtome ſeeing it remained unto <hi>Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:62131:89"/>Caeſars</hi> time, it is not likely they diſuſed the other tenths.</p>
                  <p>In like manner <hi>Gelo</hi> the <hi>Sicilian</hi> having van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed the <hi>Carthaginians</hi> in a moſt memorable bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tell, and ſlaine of them in the field an hundred and fifty thouſand men, the greateſt blow for maſſacre of men, that they at any time received in any battel: <hi>Gelo</hi> having atchieved this, he reſerved ſeverall and apart the beſt and principall of the ſpoils (which cannot well be denied to be a tenth) meaning to adorn and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour the Temple at <hi>Syracuſe:</hi> of the remains he reſerved another portion <hi>(without all doubt in quantity another tenth)</hi> which he dedicated in the principall Churches of <hi>Himera;</hi> the reſidue, after God had been ſerved, he parted among his ſoldiers and confederates.</p>
                  <p>Thus it appeareth what the cuſtome of Tithing was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Heathens, which doubtleſſe they learned as ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other things, from the people of God; as the ancient Fathers have obſerved touching many paſſages of practice in holy writ: there eſpecially, when they intreat, <hi>de Grae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corum furtis.</hi> So the names of Deities, and other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular uſages, they received from the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> (though with much difference and variety, both as comming farre, and not well apprehended, or underſtood in the carriage and delivery) ſo alſo it is very probable, that of them the <hi>Syrians, Phoenicians,</hi> and <hi>Egyptians,</hi> firſt learned to give the tenth unto God, and other holy uſages, and then more remote Nations afterward: which might well admit in paſsing up and down, and in long continuance, much variety, and not fully in every point anſwer the proto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type, or originall.</p>
                  <p>But from whence ſoever they received their firſt directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for cuſtome and practice they moſt part went beyond
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:62131:89"/>Gods own people: which though it be ſtrange, yet ſo it is, that in zeal unto piety and the ſervice of God, not onely <hi>Samaria</hi> hath exceeded <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> but even <hi>Babylon</hi> put down <hi>Sion.</hi> And ſo <hi>Theodoret</hi> complaineth, that the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did give their tenths and firſt-fruits, to be employed in their idolatrous ſervice, to the maintenance of their Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, Oratories, Prieſts, and Altars, in more liberall manner then Chriſtians: but ſaith he, <gap reason="foreign">

               <p>
                  <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour in the fourth year of his reign, when he took a view of all the ancient Laws of the Land, he firſt confirmed the liberties of the Church, becauſe that by it (ſaith <hi>Hoveden</hi>) the King and the kingdome have their ſolid foundation (<hi>pag.</hi> 601.) and herein amongſt other Laws of King <hi>Edward,</hi> theſe par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly touching Tithes; which <hi>Hen.</hi> 1. alſo did <hi>Anno</hi> 1100. as appeareth by <hi>Mat. Par. pa.</hi> 53.</p>
               <p>The like did alſo <hi>Hen.</hi> 2. in the 26. year of his reign, as <hi>Hoveden</hi> witneſſeth, <hi>pa.</hi> 600.</p>
               <p>And for a percloſe of all that went before, or ſhould follow after, King <hi>Hen.</hi> 3. in the ninth year of his reign, by that ſacred Charter made in the name of himſelf, and his heirs for ever, granted all this anew unto God. <hi>We have granted</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>unto God, and by this our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Charter have confirmed for us, and for our heirs for evermore, that the Church of</hi> England <hi>ſhall be free, and ſhall have all her holy rights inviolable.</hi> Magna
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:62131:93"/>Charta cap. 1. And that this Charter might be immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall, and like the ſanctified things of the Temple, for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver inviolable, it was not onely fortified by the Kings Seal, (the ſacred Anchor of the kingdome) but by his ſolemn oath, and the oath of his ſonne, and the Nobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the kingdome. Yea, the whole kingdome yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded themſelves to ſtand accurſed, if they ſhould at a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny time after impeach this grant. And therefore in the 25 <hi>Ed.</hi> 1. a ſpeciall Statute was made for confirmation of this Charter,<note place="margin">V. Raſtals A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridg. deſtat. tit. Confirmat.

                  <hi>Firſt, againſt all them that ſhould wittingly and maliciouſly deprive, or ſpoil Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of their rights.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, againſt thoſe that by any art or deviſe infrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the liberties of the Church or Kingdome, granted by</hi> Magna Charta <hi>&amp;</hi> de Foreſta.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly, againſt all thoſe that ſhould make new Statutes againſt the Articles of theſe Charters, or ſhould keep them being made, or bring in, or keep other cuſtomes; and againſt the writers of thoſe Statutes, Counſellors, and Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners thereof, that ſhould preſume to give judgement accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And leſt this ſhould ſeem a paſſion of ſome particular men for the preſent time, rather then a perpetuall reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the whole kingdome in the ſucceeding ages, the zeal and care thereof was continually propagated from poſterity to poſterity. So that in 42 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. <hi>cap.</hi> 1.
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:62131:93"/>it was further enacted, that if any Statute were made contrary to <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> it ſhould be void. And 15. times is this Charter confirmed by Parliament in <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. time; eight times in <hi>Rich.</hi> 2. reign; and ſix times in <hi>Hen.</hi> 4. Yea, the frontiſpice of every Parliament almoſt is a confirmation of the rights and priviledges of the Church; as having learned of the very Heathen Poet, who had it from the law of Nature, <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, we begin ever with God. Neither was there any man found, that ever would, or durſt (with <hi>Nero</hi>) lay hands upon his Mother the Church; for he that ſmiteth his father or mother, ſhall die the death, <hi>Exod.</hi> 20.15.</p>

               </q>
               <p>My meaning is not to ſtrain theſe Laws to the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of ſuch ſuperſtitious gifts as were made to the Church againſt the honour of God, but to thoſe onely that were for maintenance of his Word and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery, which if they were lawfully conferred (as no man I think doubteth but they were) then let us conſider how fearfull a thing it is to pull them from God, to rend them from the Church, to violate the dedicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our Fathers, the Oaths of our Anceſtors, the Decrees of ſo many Parliaments; and finally, to throw our ſelves into thoſe horrible curſes, that the whole body of the kingdome hath contracted with God (as <hi>Nehomiah</hi> and the <hi>Jews</hi> did, <hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.) ſhould fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them if they tranſgreſſe herein. For as <hi>Levi</hi> paid Tithes in the loins of <hi>Abraham, Heb.</hi> 7. ſo the lawfull vow of the fathers deſcendeth upon their children. And as the poſterity of <hi>Jonadab</hi> the ſonne of <hi>Rechab</hi> were bleſſed in keeping it, (<hi>Jer.</hi> 35.18.) ſo doubtleſſe have we juſt cauſe to fear the dint of this curſe in brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king this vow.</p>
               <pb n="136" facs="tcp:62131:94"/>
               <p>Say then, that Tithes were not originally due unto God, and that there belonged no portion of our Lands unto his Miniſters, yet are we in the caſe of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> and the <hi>Jews,</hi> (<hi>Nehem.</hi> 10.32.) <hi>They made Statutes by themſelves to give every year the third part of a ſhekel for the ſervice of the houſe of God.</hi> And our fathers made Laws amongſt themſelves to give a portion of their Land, and the tenth part of their ſubſtance, that is, theſe Parſonages for the ſervice of the houſe of God. If they were not due before, they are now due: <hi>For when thou voweſt a vow unto the Lord thy God, thou ſhalt not be ſlack to be pay it,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eccleſ. alſo 5.3, 4.</note> 
                  <hi>for the Lord thy God will ſurely require it of thee, and ſo it ſhould be ſin unto thee, Deut.</hi> 23.20. Therefore S. <hi>Peter</hi> reaſoning the matter with <hi>Ananias,</hi> telleth him, <hi>That whileſt his land remained in his hands, it appertained unto him; and when it was ſold, the money was his own, Act.</hi> 5.4. he might have choſen whether he would give them God or not: but when his heart had vowed, his hands were tied to perform them; he vowed all, and all was due: not by the <hi>Levitical</hi> law, which now was ended, but by the <hi>Morall</hi> law which laſteth for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; for <hi>Job</hi> being an Heathen man, and not a <hi>Jew,</hi> ſaith alſo, <hi>Thou ſhalt make thy prayer unto him, and he ſhall hear thee, and thou ſhalt render him thy vows,</hi> Job 22.27.</p>
               <p>If the King give a gift of his inheritance to his ſon, his ſon ſhall have it; if he give it to his ſervant, his ſervant ſhall have it, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 46.16. If the King then give a gift to his Father, (that is, to God Almighty) ſhall not God have it? or the ſervant to his Maſter and Maker, ſhall not he enjoy it? Who hath power to take that from God, which was given unto him according to his Word? can the Biſhops? can the
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:62131:94"/>Clergy give this away? no, they are but <hi>Vſufructuarii,</hi> they have but the uſe of it; the thing it ſelf is Gods, for the words of the grant be, <hi>Concedimus Deo,</hi> we give it to God, not to the Biſhops. Therefore when <hi>Valen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinian</hi> the Emperor required the Church of <hi>Milan,</hi> of that noble Biſhop S. <hi>Ambroſe, O</hi> ſaith he, <hi>if any thing were required of me that were mine, as my land, my houſe,</hi>

                  <hi>my gold, or my ſilver, whatſoever were mine, I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly offer it, but</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>I can take nothing from the Church, nor deliver that to others, which I my ſelf recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved but to keep, and not to deliver.</hi>

               <argument>
                  <p>Tithe is not meerly <hi>Leviticall:</hi> How it is, and how not; and wherein <hi>Judiciall.</hi>
                  </p>
               </argument>
               <p>TIthe is not ſimply a <hi>Leviticall</hi> duty, but reſpective<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; not the naturall childe of <hi>Moſes</hi> Law, but the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doptive: Conſider firſt the action, and then the end; the action, in payment of them; the end, in the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or diſpoſing of them: The action of payment of them cannot be ſaid to be properly <hi>Leviticall</hi> for divers reaſons.</p>
               <p n="1">Firſt, it is much more ancient then the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, as is already declared, and cannot therefore bee ſaid to begin by it, or to be meerly <hi>Leviticall.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">Secondly, the manner of eſtabliſhing of it in the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, ſeemeth rather to be an annexion of a thing formerly in uſe, then the creating or erecting of a new cuſtome; for in all the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, there is no originall commandement to pay Tithe, but in the place where firſt it is mentioned, <hi>Lev.</hi> 27.30. it is poſitively declared to be the Lords, without any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:62131:95"/>precedent to yeeld it to him. Some hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily will affirm the commandement in the 22. <hi>Exod. that thou ſhalt not keep back thy Tithe,</hi> doth belong to the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, though it were given before the <hi>Levites</hi> were aſcribed to the Tabernacle. Yet (if it were ſo) that is no fundamentall Law whereupon to ground the firſt erection of paying Tithe, but rather as a Law of revive, and confirmation, as of a thing for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly <hi>in eſſe:</hi> for detaining and keeping back doe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently imply a former right, and therefore Tithe was ſtill the Lords, <hi>ex antiquiore jure,</hi> and not <hi>ex novi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tio praecepto,</hi> by a precedent right, and not by a new commandement.</p>
               <p n="3">Thirdly, it containeth no matter of ceremony; for if it did, then muſt it be a type and figure of ſome future thing, and by the paſſion of our Saviour Chriſt bee converted from a carnall rite into ſome ſpirituall obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, (for ſo ſaith <hi>Jerome</hi> of the legall ceremonies) but no ſuch thing appeareth in it, and therefore it cannot be ſaid to be a ceremony. The whole body of the Fathers doe confirm this, who in all their works doe confidently affirm the doctrine that S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much beateth upon, that all legall ceremonies be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boliſhed; and yet as many of them as ſpeak of Tithes, doe without all controverſie both conclude and teach, that ſtill they ought to be paid, and therefore plainly not to be a ceremony.</p>
               <p n="4">Fourthly, the Tithing now uſed, is not after the manner of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law; for by the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law nothing was tithed, but ſuch things as renued and encreaſed out of the profits of the earth; but our man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of tithing is after that of <hi>Abrahams,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Heb. 7.2.</note> 
                  <hi>who gave tithe of all.</hi> And this is a thing well to be confidered,
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:62131:95"/>for therein as <hi>Abraham</hi> tithed to <hi>Melchiſedek</hi> not being of the Tribe of <hi>Levi:</hi> ſo our Tithing is now to Chriſt being of <hi>Melchiſedeks</hi> order, and not of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> but of that of <hi>Juda,</hi> whereunto the Tribe of <hi>Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi</hi> is alſo to pay their Tithe.</p>
               <p n="5">Fifthly and laſtly, the end whereunto Tithe was ordained is plainly <hi>Morall,</hi> and that in three main points: Piety, Juſtice, and Gratitude. 1. Piety, as for the worſhip of God. 2. Juſtice, as for the wages and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muneration of his Miniſters. 3. Gratitude,<note place="margin">And to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them in the ſervice of God. 2 Chron. 31.4.</note> as <hi>ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cium laudis,</hi> an offering of thankfulneſſe for his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits received. All which were apparent in the uſe of Tithes before they were aſſigned over to the <hi>Levites,</hi> both in the examples of <hi>Abraham</hi> and <hi>Jacob,</hi> and by the practice of all Nations. For God was to be worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped before, in, and after the Law, and though the Law had never been given; but his worſhip could not be without Miniſters, nor his Miniſters without mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance; and therefore the maintenance of his Miniſters was the maintenance of his worſhip; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the tithes applied to the one extended to both. God himſelf doth ſo expound it, <hi>Mal.</hi> 3.8. where he tearm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the not-payment of Tithes to bee his ſpoil: and wherein his ſpoil, but in his worſhip? and how in his worſhip, but by taking from him, the ſervice of his Miniſters, the Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> who being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived thereof could neither perform his holy rites in matter of charge, nor give their attendance for want of maintenance?</p>
               <p>So that herein the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were not onely guilty of that great ſinne committed againſt piety, in hindering the worſhip of God; but of the crying ſin alſo committed againſt equity, in withholding the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:62131:96"/>of the labourer, (his Miniſters) and conſequently of that monſtrous and foul ſin of Ingratitude, which <hi>Jacob</hi> in vowing of his Tithes ſo carefully avoided.</p>
               <p>To come to the other point before ſpoken of, the diſpoſing or employment of the Tithes after they were paid, (that is, when they were out of the power of them that paid them, and at the ordering of the <hi>Levites</hi> that received them) it cannot be denied; but therein were many ceremonies, as namely, in the ſanctifying of them, in the eating them in the Tabernacle, the eating of them by the <hi>Levites</hi> onely and their family; and as they were otherwiſe applied to the ceremoniall habit of Gods ſervice for that time: but yet notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, even then they ſtill ſerved in the main point to the <hi>Morall</hi> end of their originall Inſtitution; that is, the worſhip of God <hi>in genere;</hi> the maintenance of his Miniſters <hi>in genere;</hi> and for a token of thankfulneſſe <hi>in genere.</hi> Againſt which the particular applying them to the particular form of worſhip, and ceremonies of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, (for that time aboliſhed) had no repugnancy. And therefore though that manner of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing them were <hi>Ceremoniall,</hi> and did vaniſh away with the ceremonies themſelves: yet did it nothing dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the <hi>Morall</hi> uſe, and validity of the Inſtitution <hi>in genere;</hi> which notwithſtanding ſtill remained to be accepted and imitated by all poſterity; and yet to be altered and changed accidentally in the particular orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring and diſpoſing of them, as the preſent eſtate of Gods worſhip, and the neceſſity of the time ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, <hi>viz.</hi> before the Law, at the pleaſure of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Law: under the Law, by the rules of the Law: and now in the time of the Goſpel, as the Church of God either hath, or ſhall appoint them:
<pb n="143" facs="tcp:62131:96"/>keeping always (as I ſay) the <hi>Morall</hi> conſiderations of their Inſtitution, for they may not be diverted from the Miniſter, though the courſe of Gods ſervice be altered from that of the <hi>Levites,</hi> but both they and the <hi>Levites</hi> are labourers in the Lords Vineyard; and therefore what kind of work ſoever, either the one, or the other, be for the time there employed upon, the wages ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed (<hi>Denarius in diem, Mat.</hi> 20.2.) is due unto each of them.</p>
               <p>Therefore to take away the <hi>antitheſis,</hi> or oppoſition that ſome make between the Miniſters of the Goſpel, and the <hi>Levites</hi> and Prieſts of the Law; God himſelf in the laſt of <hi>Eſay, v.</hi> 21.<note place="margin">Eſay 66, 20.</note> calleth the Miniſters of the Goſpel Prieſts and <hi>Levites,</hi> as though he had onely changed the courſe of their ſervice, and not the main, or end of their Inſtitution. <hi>I will take of them</hi> (<hi>viz. of the</hi> Gentiles) <hi>for Prieſts and Levites,</hi> that is, the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of <hi>Levi</hi> ſhall no longer be appropriate to my ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but I will communicate their function to the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> and out of them will I take Prieſts and <hi>Levites</hi> to perform the ſervice of my charge.</p>
               <p>God therefore brought no new thing into the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> Law, neither changed he the nature of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Inſtitution thereof, nor the courſe of the pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nor the quantity of the portion aſſigned, nor the end whereto it was; but looking generally into the equity of them all, and approving them all in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall, (yea, though they were uſed by the Heathen) he deſcended into further particularities for order and government, whereof he preſcribed divers rules, and obſervances, ſome <hi>Morall,</hi> ſome <hi>Judiciall,</hi> and ſome <hi>Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remoniall,</hi> according to the faſhion of his Church at that time; which like old garments being wholly
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:62131:97"/>worn out with the old Law, the body whereupon they were put, remaineth ſtill in the firſt ſhape and vigour. And whereas before the Law it ſeemeth to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what at randome and uncertain, God by his owne mouth in the Books of <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath eſtabliſhed, and confirmed. So that theſe things conſidered, it cannot be ſaid to be <hi>Leviticall</hi> in ſubſtance, but reſpectively onely, and by way of accident.</p>

                     <hi>§ 1.</hi> An Objection touching ſacrifice, and firſt-fruits, and circumciſion.</head>
                  <p>It may be objected, that ſacrifice and firſt-fruits were alſo in uſe under the law of Nature, and from thence, (as Tithe was) tranſlated into the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law: yet they ceaſed with the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, and why ſhould not Tithe ceaſe likewiſe?</p>
                  <p>Though ſacrifice and firſt-fruits were in uſe under the law of Nature, and from thence (as Tithe was) tranſlated unto the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, yet the mark they ſhot at, and the end whereto they were employed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once accompliſhed, there was in reaſon no further uſe of them; for they were like the cloudy and fiery pillars, that directed the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> to the land of promiſe, who being arrived there, needed thoſe helps no longer, and ſo they vaniſhed away, as then not neceſſary. But Tithe in it ſelf and before the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, was onely an act of juſtice and piety; and therefore though the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, employed it partly unto ceremonies, yet the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof was not thereby changed, and therefore it ſtill lived, when the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law died. Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching the whole frame of <hi>Leviticall</hi> ceremonies, it is
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:62131:97"/>like that of <hi>Daniels</hi> image: the body is decayed and gone, but the legs being partly iron, as well as clay, by which it was ſupported; though the clay, that is, the ceremony be aboliſhed, yet the iron, that is, the <hi>Morall</hi> Inſtitution thereof, endureth for ever.</p>
                  <p>The rites of the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law were of two ſorts; ſome the naturall children thereof, others the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive. I call them naturall, that ſprang out of the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of it, as thoſe touching the Ark, and Inſtitution of the <hi>Levites.</hi> Adoptive, thoſe that being in uſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were afterward annexed to it: And of theſe I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve two ſorts, one ariſing from ſome poſitive Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, as that of Circumciſion; (whereof I will ſpeak anon) and the other deduced from the law of Nature, as thoſe concerning the worſhip of God: whereof ſome were generall and neceſſarily incident to every form of his worſhip in all ages; as Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters to perform his ſervice, which they called Prieſts, and means to maintain it, which they ordained to be by Tithes. The other appropriate to the naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe times; as ſacrifice, and firſt-fruits, which though they roſe out of the law of Nature, as touching the common end of being offered by way of thankſgiving unto God; yet in that they were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo types and figures, full of ceremony, they became temporall, and thereby tranſitory. For the children of <hi>Adam</hi> finding themſelves in the wrath of God; and their fleſh, bloud, body, and life, to be altogether corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and accurſed by the tranſgreſſion of their father; they ſought by all invention poſſible to help it as far as nature could; and therefore both to expreſſe the preſent eſtate of their miſerable condition, and the mark alſo they aimed at for redemption in time
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:62131:98"/>to come, they held it as a neceſſary correſpondency, that fleſh ſhould be redeemed with fleſh, bloud with bloud, life with life, the guilty body with a guiltleſſe body, and to be ſhort, the treſpaſſe and corruption of man, by the innocency of ſome ſanctified creature of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered unto God for remiſſion of ſin. And becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing under the ſun could be offered up, but it alſo was full of corruption, and that nothing could be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable unto God, that was impure, therefore though they choſe the cleaneſt and perfecteſt beaſts, and things for theſe offerings and ſacrifices, and purged and ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified them by all manner of means they could, yet they deviſed further to ſever the purer and aeriall part thereof from the groſſe and earthly; conſuming the one, that is to ſay, the fleſh and the bones (as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin and corruption) with the deſerved torment of fire, and ſending the other, that is, the fume and vapour, as the purer part to carry their prayers and invocations up into heaven, before the Throne of God. Firſt, how corruptible they were, that is, even like the great body of a bullock ſuddainly conſumed. Secondly, the puniſhment in juſtice due unto them, even the torment of fire. Thirdly, the place and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon from whence they hoped for redemption: Heaven and Almighty God. And laſtly, the means whereby they were to attain it, taken from two of the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of fire, light and heat: that is, firſt, the light of faith, whereby they long foreſaw the promiſed ſeed; and ſecondly, the heat of zeal and hearty prayer, brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thed and ſent forth from the altar of a fervent heart, whereby they hoped to obtain remiſſion of their ſins.</p>
                  <p>After all this they yet conſidering further, that the corruption and wrath fallen upon them was perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all,
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:62131:98"/>and that theſe oblations and ſacrifices were but temporall and momentary, they thought in reaſon (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing onely under the law of Reaſon) that the one could not countervail the other, and that therefore it was neceſſary by continuall reiteration and multiplying of ſacrifices to ſollicite and importune God from day to day untill the time came, that a perpetuall ſacrifice might be offered up to make <hi>ſinalem concordiam,</hi> in the high Court of heaven, a full atonement betweene God and man: which being once accompliſhed by our Saviour Chriſt, both the inſtitution and the end of ſacrificing were wholly accompliſhed, and ſo no cauſe for ever after to uſe that ceremony any more. <hi>For with one offering,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle to the <hi>Hebrews, hath he conſecrated for ever them that are ſanctified,</hi> Heb. 10.14.</p>
                  <p>Touching Circumciſion, though it were before the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Law, yet it riſe not out of the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or <hi>Morall</hi> Law, but was inſtituted by a poſitive conſtitution, made by God himſelf, and not as a part of his worſhip, but as a ſeal of his Covenant with <hi>Abraham,</hi> which by this ceremony of cutting away the impurer part of the fleſh, did put the children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ever in mind to caſt away carnall affections, and to hope for the promiſed Meſſias, that ſhould cleanſe them from the impurity of ſin, and reſtore them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to the favour of God: which being performed by our Saviour, the Covenant was fulfilled, and the ſeal of Circumciſion preſently thereby defaced.</p>

                  <p>The Inſtitution of the Sabbath day had in it much more <hi>Levitical</hi> ceremony, then the matter of tithing; for no man ought to kindle a fire on that day, nor dreſſe the meat he ſhould eat,<note place="margin">Exod. 35.3.16.24. Jer. 17.11.</note> nor carry any burden, take a journey, or ſtir out of the place he was in. <hi>Tarry eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry man in his place, let no man goe out of his place the ſeventh day, Exod.</hi> 16.29. It was beſides a day appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for divers particular ceremonies, ſacrifices, and offerings, as yee may read, <hi>Num.</hi> 28.9, 10. and amongſt other ſignifications, to be a memoriall of the great deliverance out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> (a thing peculiar to the <hi>Jews.</hi>) Neither have we any commandement, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a precedent for the keeping of it, from the Apoſtles, <hi>Acts</hi> 20.9. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.2. <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.10. Yet durſt never any man ſay, that the Sabbath was therefore to be abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, but the temporall and ceremoniall parts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of being taken away, the morall uſe of the comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, which is, that the ſeventh part of our time muſt be dedicate to the generall ſervice of God, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maineth for ever to the worlds end; for otherwiſe our Sabbath is ſo remote from the Sabbath commanded in the Decalogue, that the one holdeth almoſt no affinity with the other, as appeareth in the points aforeſaid; and for that their Sabbath was the laſt day of the week, ours is the firſt: theirs was in celebration of the end of his workes, ours in celebration of the beginning thereof; for in the firſt day were the Elements, the Angels, &amp;c. made. <hi>Auguſt. Tom.</hi> 10. <hi>fol.</hi> 250. Theirs in memory of the Creation of the world, ours of the Redemption, that Chriſt riſe from the dead the firſt
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:62131:99"/>day of the week. And though the Apoſtles taught us by example to exchange the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath for this of ours, as touching the publique meeting on the firſt day of the week, for ſetting forth the glory of God, yet they gave us no commandement to abſtain from work on that day; but the Church decreed, ſaith S. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſtine,</hi> that all the honour of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Sabbath ſhould be transferred to the Chriſtian; <hi>(loco dicto)</hi> and is done upon the <hi>Morall</hi> reaſon of the commandement, not the <hi>Leviticall.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So likewiſe in tithing, cut off thoſe parts that were temporall, and ceremoniall, which as I have ſhewed were neither in the payment, nor in the receiving of them, but in the manner of ſanctifying and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of part of them, after the <hi>Levites</hi> were poſſeſſed of them: and then that which remaineth, namely, the payment and receiving of them for maintenance of the ſervice of God remaineth for ever, as a part of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, and common equity.</p>
                  <p>So touching <hi>Eaſter,</hi> Chriſt our Paſſeover was ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed for us, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.7. and thereby the end of Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution accompliſhed: how come we then to continue it, eſpecially, having neither commandement, nor pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent thereof from the Apoſtles? The <hi>Ceremoniall</hi> part of the Paſchall feaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Leviticall</hi> Lamb, the Purification precedent, &amp;c. are aboliſhed with the Law, yet in that Chriſt came in the room of that <hi>Leviticall</hi> Lamb, and was ſacrificed at the ſame time, and gave his body to be broken and eaten by all, as the Paſchall Lamb was for a ſatisfaction for our ſins, as S. <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> ſaith, <hi>Ecce Agnus Dei</hi>—therefore is that Feaſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, as it was formerly uſed, without changing either the number of the days, or ſeaſon of the year,
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:62131:100"/>or the ſolemn eſtimation that was anciently had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of: yet note that <hi>Eaſter</hi> is kept according to the <hi>Levi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticall</hi> manner for the time, after the full Moon, and is therefore moveable; whereas the day that Chriſt ſuffered is otherwiſe fixed, as that of the Nativity.</p>
                  <p>So likewiſe <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> being the 50. day from the firſt Paſſeover, eaten by the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and the day alſo whereon the Law was given in Mount <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai,</hi> and therefore hallowed as one of the three great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt feaſts; the Law then being ended, the celebrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the birth-day thereof, muſt in all reaſon alſo be ended; yet becauſe the fulneſſe of grace, (that holdeth always an <hi>Antitheſis</hi> with the Law) that is, the holy Ghoſt in ſhape of cloven tongues was at the end of 50. days after Chriſts firſt Paſſeover ſent down upon the Apoſtles; therefore is that Feaſt alſo continued, at the ſame time and number of days, that the <hi>Jews</hi> uſed it: although in all the New Teſtament we have nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther commandement, nor example for keeping either of theſe Feaſts; for though it be ſaid, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.1. <hi>that when</hi> Pentecoſt <hi>was come, the Apoſtles were all toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in one place,</hi> yet was not that their meeting to celebrate the <hi>Judaical</hi> Feaſt: but becauſe the people from all parts then flocked to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Apoſtles were there alſo, for the better publiſhing of the Goſpel, and for the ſame reaſon was the holy Ghoſt alſo in this miraculous manner ſent at this time, that by this means the ſame thereof might be carried throughout all the world. For it cannot be intended, that the Apoſtles met to celebrate the Chriſtians feaſt, inſomuch as at the beginning of this their meeting the holy Ghoſt was not ſent upon them. Yet all this while, nor in the Apoſtles time, as far as the New Teſtament diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:62131:100"/>was <hi>Eaſter</hi> uſed, nor the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt;</hi> for though it be ſaid, that when the Feaſt of <hi>Pentecoſt</hi> was come, they were all with one accord in one place, <hi>Act.</hi> 2.1. that is,<note place="margin">Nemo non ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctificatus faciat Phaſe. <hi>Nu. 9.6.</hi> hac ceremonia ſublata, manet feſium.</note> at the time when the cloven tongues fell upon them, this like the Sabbath was the <hi>Jews Pente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coſt,</hi> not the Chriſtians; for it anſwered to the <hi>Eaſter</hi> that the <hi>Jews</hi> had then laſt holden, not to that our Saviour kept, being the day before the <hi>Jews.</hi> So that neither of theſe Feaſts ſeem to be begun in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles time, but rather by their next ſucceſſors; yet Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 16.8. ſaith, <hi>I will tarry at</hi> Epheſus <hi>till</hi> Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecoſt, <hi>for a great door and effectuall is opened unto me, and there are many adverſaries:</hi> as though he deſired at that great Feaſt, to take the opportunity to publiſh the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and confute his adverſaries.</p>

               <argument>
                  <p>How Appropriations began.</p>
               </argument>
               <p>MAny things are notoriouſly wicked in concluſion, whoſe beginnings are not ſuſpected: ſo hath it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in Appropriations. The Livings that belong to them, were firſt given for the maintenance of the Church &amp; her family, that is, Miniſters and poor people. In the Primitive Church the Biſhops diſpoſed them accordingly, but the burden growing in time too great for them, the Parſons were themſelves truſted to doe it every one in his own Pariſh. Then divers religious men, as Abbots, Priors, ſingle Deans and Prebends, that had advowſons to them and their ſucceſſors, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving this, began firſt to collate themſelves to thoſe Churches, and for lucres ſake were contented in their own perſons to doe the divine ſervice thereof; and find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:62131:101"/>ſweetneſſe in it, as enjoying thereby the whole fruits of the Benefice. Every ſucceſſor did the like, and by that means kept the Living perpetually in their owne hands, without any favour, or thanks of, or to the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary; at length to avoid the multiplicity of Inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Inductions, they eaſily obtained licence of the King and Ordinary (ſometimes of the Pope him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf) that without theſe uſuall ceremonies, they and their ſucceſſors might be perpetuall Incumbents, and take the profits of thoſe their Benefices. In old time whileſt theſe Churches were in the Clergy-hand, they were called Appropriations, becauſe they were appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priate to a particular ſucceſſion of Church-men; now they are called Impropriations, for they are improperly in the hands of Lay-men.</p>
               <p>But thus Churches became firſt appropriate, yet onely unto ſuch as were meerly ſpirituall, and might in their own perſon miniſter the ſacraments and divine ſervice. But ſhortly after Deans and Chapters obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed like licenſes to them and their ſucceſſors, who being a Body corporate, conſiſting of a multitude, could not jointly perform this function, and in particular none of them was tied unto it. Then was it deviſed, that by their common ſeal (which is the tongue of their Corporation) they might appoint a Deputy or Vicar to doe it for them; which invention gave the wound un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church, whereof ſhe bleedeth at this day.</p>
               <p>By theſe examples, Abbots, Priors, ſingle Deans and Prebends, that before ſerved God in their own perſons, learned alſo to doe it now by Vicars and Subſtitutes, and ſo like faithleſſe ſhepheards left their flocks to care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe pages, themſelves minding nothing but the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Livings. And this device being once a foot,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:62131:101"/>the very Nuns and Prioreſſes (that could by no means adminiſter theſe holy rites) laid hold thereof, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing religious perſons obtained alſo the ſame Licences: all of them pretending that with great fidelity they would ſee that performed effectually to the Church and poor, that thoſe Livings were at firſt ordained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, Divine ſervice, and Hoſpitality. By this window crept the Vicars into Churches, who for the moſt part were ſome of the Monaſtery, whereunto the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriation belonged; till the ſtatute of 4 <hi>H.</hi> 4. <hi>cap.</hi> 12. provided, <hi>That in every Church ſo appropriate, a ſecular perſon be ordained Vicar perpetuall, Canonically inſtitute and induct in the ſame, and convenably indowed by the diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Ordinary,</hi> (1) <hi>to doe divine ſervice,</hi> (2) <hi>and to inform the people,</hi> (3) <hi>and to keep hoſpitality there — and that no Religious be in any wiſe made Vicars, in any Church ſo appropriate, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus came Vicars to get a lock out of the Parſons fleece, which though it were a very poor one, yet was it in ſome ſort proportionable to the deſerts and quality of ſuch heardmen, inſomuch as then they were ſingle men, as well as ſimple Clerks; but yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were thus indued before this Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, for in the Synod holden at <gap reason="blank" extent="1 word">
                     <desc> _____ </desc>
                  </gap> for the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of <hi>Canterbury, Anno</hi> 1222. <hi>ca.</hi> 18. it was ordained, that leſſe ſhould not be aſſigned to a perpetuall Vicar then five marks a year in rent, which in the propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the rents of that time hold to this, cannot be leſſe then 30<hi rend="sup">l</hi> or 40<hi rend="sup">l</hi> a year.</p>
               <p>So that the Appropriation of a Parſonage was no more at the firſt, but a grant made by the Pope, &amp;c. to an Abbot, Prior, Prebend, or ſome other ſpirituall perſon, being a Body politique and ſucceſſive, that he
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:62131:102"/>and his ſucceſſors might for ever be Parſons of that Church, that is, that as one of them died, his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors might enter into the Rectory, and take the fruits and profits thereof, without further trouble of admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,<note place="margin">Plowd. 500.</note> inſtitution, or induction; which upon the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was no more but to doe that briefly at one cut, that otherwiſe might and would in length of time be done at ſeverall times, as to admit, inſtitute, and induct the whole ſucceſſion of a religious body po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litique at once, whereas otherwiſe every ſucceſſour muſt have had a particular inſtitution and induction; and therefore every ſuch ſucceſſour during his time, was as perfect an Incumbent, as if he had been particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly inſtituted and inducted: but when the ſucceſſion failed, then it was again preſentative as upon the death of an ordinary Incumbent: and by extinction of the Houſe, diſſolution, ceſſion, or ſurrender of the Houſe and Order, the appropriation is determined, and they are now again preſentative:<note place="margin">Dier Plowd. 497.</note> for the appropriation is but as a ſtop in a run,<note place="margin">Manwood 501</note> which being taken away, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer right renueth.</p>
               <p>What alteration then did the Statute make of them? did it make them lay, or temporall Livings? no, the words of the Statute are, <hi>That the King ſhall have them in as large and ample manner, as the Governors of thoſe houſes had them, &amp;c.</hi> So that though the Statute chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged the owner of the thing, yet it changed not the nature of the thing. The Monaſticall perſons had them before as ſpirituall Livings, and now the King muſt have them in as large manner, but ſtill as ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall Livings: and with much more reaſon might the King ſo have them, then any other temporall men; for as the Kingdome and Prieſthood were united in
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:62131:102"/>the perſon of our Saviour Chriſt, ſo the perſon of a King is not excluded from the function of a Prieſt, though as Chriſt being a Prieſt, medled not with the kingdome, ſo they as Kings, medle not with the Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Yet by the Laws of the Land the King is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed as well of a ſpirituall body politique as of a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall, and by this his ſpirituall body he is ſaid to be ſupream Ordinary, that is, chief Biſhop over all the Biſhops in <hi>England,</hi> and in that his Eccleſiaſticall or Spirituall authority, doth many things, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe in his temporall he could not doe; and therefore the Statute of 25 <hi>H.</hi> 8. <hi>cap.</hi> doth agniſe the words,<note place="margin">In this part of his power <hi>W</hi> made Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priations of Parſonages, which other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he could not doe. <hi>Coke p.</hi> 5. <hi>f.</hi> 10</note>

Neither is this authority of the King foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Statute of <hi>H.</hi> 8. or any other puiſne inſtitution, but deduced anciently from the very Sax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Kings, as appeareth by many of their Laws, and Charters, wherein as ſupream Ordinary they diſpoſe of the rights, and juriſdiction of the Church, delivering unto religious perſons, greater or leſſer por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof, according to their own pleaſure, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridging and exempting other from the authority of the Biſhops, and Archbiſhops, or any other Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſticall Prelate. And in this reſpect it ſeemeth that the Chappell of the Kings houſe was in ancient time un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no other Ordinary, then the King himſelf; for <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour granting all exemption to <hi>Battail Abbey,</hi> granteth that it ſhall be as free from the command of any Biſhops, as his own Chappell.

               <p>
                  <hi>But the Biſhops agreed to the granting away of theſe Church Livings.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>It is true, that the Law accounteth the judgement of the major part, to be the judgement of all: but the Biſhops cannot be ſaid to have agreed unto it, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing willing with it, but as concluded by legall neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and inference. For though all the Biſhops ſaid nay, yet the Lay Barons by reaſon of their number excee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the Biſhops were not able to hinder it: and no man doubteth, that in publique ſuffrages, very many times, <hi>major pars vincit meliorem;</hi> therefore I neither accuſe, nor condemn the reverend Biſhops herein: for their voices, though they had given them every one againſt the Bill, were not able to hinder it. Neither doe I think but that they being men of another pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, unexerciſed in the elenchs of the Law, were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in the frame of words, and thereby paſſed that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in a cloud, which if they had perceived could never have been won from them with iron hooks. But in this matter, there being a queſtion of Religion; Whether Tithes be due <hi>jure divino,</hi> or whether they could be ſeparated from the Church; it was not properly a queſtion decidable by the Parliament, being compoſed wholly of Lay perſons, except ſome twenty Biſhops, but the queſtion ſhould firſt have been moved amongſt the Biſhops by themſelves, and the Clergy in the Convocation houſe, and then being there agreed of according to the Word of God, brought into the Parliament. For as the Temporall Lords exclude the Biſhops when it commeth to the deciſion of a matter of bloud, life and member: ſo by the like reaſon, the
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:62131:103"/>Biſhops ought to exclude the Temporall Lords, when it commeth to the deciſion of a queſtion in Theology; for God hath committed the Tabernacle to <hi>Levi,</hi> as well as the kingdome to <hi>Juda:</hi> and though <hi>Juda</hi> have power over <hi>Levi,</hi> as touching the outward govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, even of the Temple it ſelf; yet <hi>Juda</hi> medled not with the Oracle, &amp; the holy Miniſtery, but received the will of God from the mouth of the Prieſt. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when <hi>Valentinian</hi> the Emperour required <hi>Ambroſe</hi> to come and diſpute a point of <hi>Arianiſme</hi> at his Court, he beſought the Emperour, that he might doe it in the Conſiſtory amongſt the Biſhops, and that the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour would bee pleaſed not to be preſent among them, leſt his preſence ſhould captivate their judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, or intangle their liberty.</p>

                  <p>Spirituall things and ſpirituall men are correlatives, and cannot in reaſon be divorced: therefore was no man capable of Appropriations but ſpirituall perſons before the laws of diſſolution, which firſt violated this holy marriage, and (like <hi>Abimelech, Gen.</hi> 20.2.) took the wife from the husband, and made Lay men which before were the children of the Church now become ſpirituall Fathers. The act of Appropriation is nothing but to make a body corporate or politique ſpirituall, that hath ſucceſſion, perpetuall Incumbents in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory; or no more, upon the matter, then to entail the incumbency to one certain ſucceſſion of ſpirituall men. Therefore as a Patron (ſaith my Lord <hi>Dyer,</hi> Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, and <hi>Plowden</hi> 496.) muſt preſent a ſpirituall perſon to a Church, and not a temporall: ſo by the ſame reaſon, an Appropriation muſt be made unto a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall perſon, and not temporall; for ſaith he, the one hath cure of ſouls, as well as the other: and they differ in nothing but in this, the one is Parſon for his life, and the other and his ſucceſſours, Parſons ſhall be for ever: and for this in the beginning (ſaith he) were
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:62131:105"/>the Appropriations made to Abbots, Priors, Deans, Prebends and ſuch like, as might (in their own per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) miniſter the Sacraments, and Sacramentals, and to none other. And for the ſame reaſon at the firſt it was holden, that they could not grant their eſtates to any other, no more then the Incumbent of a Parſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage preſentative, who though he may leaſe his Glebe, and Tithes, yet can he not grant his Incumbency to any other, but muſt reſign it; and then the Patron and Biſhop muſt make the new Incumbent. And ſo the Incumbency which is a ſpirituall office cannot be granted, nor by the ſame reaſon could the perpetuall Incumbent (which is the Approprietary) at the firſt grant his eſtate which contained the Incumbency, and the Rectory, which is the revenue of the Incumbent.</p>
                  <p>Therefore when the Order of the Templars (to whom divers appropriate Parſonages were belonging) was diſſolved, and their poſſeſſions granted to the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of S. <hi>John</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> Juſtice <hi>Herle</hi> in 3 <hi>Ed.</hi> 3. ſaid, that if the Templars had granted their eſtate in the Appropriations to the Hoſpitalers, that is, to them of S. <hi>Johns</hi> of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Hoſpitalers ſhould not have it; for it was granted onely to the Templars, and they could not make an Appropriation thereof over unto others. Therefore to make good the eſtate of the Prior and Hoſpitalers, it was ſhewed there that by the grant of the Pope, King, and Parliament, the Prior had the eſtate of the Templars: And ſo by <hi>Herle,</hi> an Appropriation cannot be transferred to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and with good reaſon, (ſaith the book) for it hath in it a perpetuall Incumbency, which is a ſpirituall function appropriate to a certain perſon ſpirituall, and cannot be removed from them in whom it was firſt ſetled by any act of theirs.</p>

                  <p>Abbots, Priors, and ſuch religious men had two ſorts of Tithes; one incorporate to their Houſes, which I call Monaſticall Tithes: the other depending upon their function, as they were Parſons of any Pariſh, which therefore I call Pariſh Tithes. 1. The firſt of theſe came unto them, as their very lands did, by plain point of Charter; for before the <hi>Lugdune</hi> and <hi>Lateran</hi> Councels, every man might beſtow his Tithes upon what religious Houſe perſon he liſted: and then the founders and benefactors of religious Houſes did ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily grant all or ſome portion of their Tithes to thoſe Houſes, as by a multitude of precedents there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of

                  <p>Though the Parliament hath power to diſpoſe tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall inheritance, and to make Lawes to binde the rights of ſubjects, yet it is confeſſed by the Books of the Law themſelves, that it can eſtabliſh nothing againſt the law of God; and therefore if Tithes be in the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy by the Law of God, as before we have ſhewed, then can they not be pulled from him by any law of man. Neither hath the Parliament as it ſeemeth at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to doe it, but inſomuch as they were miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>employed by the Clergy of that time, therefore the Parliament took them from them, and gave them to the King, not in any new courſe of property, or to be

                  <p>This point dependeth upon the precedent, for the end why they were given unto the King, is declared by the manner of giving them unto him.

<pb n="166" facs="tcp:62131:108"/>be to the pleaſure of God, and the honour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of the Realm. But it cannot be to the pleaſure of God, that his Miniſters ſhould be defrauded; nor to the honour and profit of the Realm, that the ſervice of God ſhould be hindered, or neglected, and therefore the King muſt have and hold them to thoſe purpoſes, and to none other.</p>
                  <p>And that the King was not deceived in this kinde of conſtruction of the Act of Parliament, it appeareth by a Declaration made by himſelf freely in an Ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his unto the Parliament, <hi>Anno</hi> 37. of his reign, where he ſaith,— <q>I cannot a little rejoyce, when I conſider <hi>the perfect truſt and confidence,</hi> which you have put in me, as men having <hi>undoubted hope, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned beleef,</hi> in my good doings and juſt proceedings; for you without my deſire or requeſt, have commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to my order and diſpoſition all Chauntries, Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledges, Hoſpitals, and other places ſpecified in a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Act, firmly truſting, that I will order them to the <hi>glory of God, and the profit of the Common-wealth.</hi> Surely, if I contrary to your expectation ſhould ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of the Church to decay, or <hi>Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> (which is ſo great a jewell) to bee miniſhed, or poor and miſerable to be unrelieved, you might well ſay, that I being put in ſo ſpeciall a <hi>Truſt,</hi> as I am in this caſe, were no truſty friend to you, nor charitable to my <hi>even Chriſtian,</hi> neither a lover of the publique wealth, nor yet one that feared God, to whom ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count muſt bee rendred of all our doings.

                  <p>It being thus manifeſted, what are the chief ends and uſes of Parſonages, it appears how unjuſt it is to tolerate Appropriations, and how miſerable their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition is who hold them: Oh how lamentable is the caſe of a poor Approprietary, that dying, thinketh of no other account, but of that touching his lay voca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and then comming before the Judgement ſeat of Almighty God, muſt anſwer alſo for this ſpirituall function; firſt, why he medled with it, not being called unto it; then why (medling with it) he did not the duty that belongeth unto it, in ſeeing the Church carefully ſerved, the Miniſter thereof ſufficiently maintained, and the poor of the Pariſh faithfully relie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. This, I ſay, is the uſe whereto Parſonages were given, and of this uſe we had notice before we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed them; and therefore not onely by the Laws of God, and the Church, but by the Law of the Land, and the rules of the Chancery, at this day obſerved, we ought onely to hold them to this uſe, and no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.

For the King, as meerly a temporall Magiſtrate,
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:62131:112"/>commandeth nothing in Eccleſiaſticall cauſes, neither as the ſupream Officer of the Church doth he interpoſe in the temporall government: but like the common arch ariſing from both theſe pillars he protecteth and combineth them in perpetuall ſtability, governing that of the Church by his Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, and that of the Common-wealth by his temporall. For this cauſe, as <hi>Moſes</hi> was counted <hi>in ſacerdotibus, Pſal.</hi> 99.6. though he were the temporall Governour of the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſo the Laws of the Land have of old armed the King, <hi>perſona mixta, medium,</hi> or rather <hi>commune quid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam inter laicos &amp; ſacerdotes:</hi> and have thereupon juſtly aſſigned to him a politique body, compoſed as well of Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, as temporall, like to that of <hi>David, Jehoſaphat, Hezekias,</hi> and other Kings of <hi>Juda,</hi> who not onely in reſpect of their Crown, led the Armies of the people againſt their enemies: but as anointed with the holy oyle, ordered and diſpoſed the very function of the <hi>Levites,</hi> of the Prieſts, and of the Temple, as you may read in their ſeverall lives in the books of the <hi>Kings</hi> and <hi>Chronicles.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But the Kings of <hi>England</hi> have proceeded yet fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the gradations of Eccleſiaſticall profeſſion, as thinking it with <hi>David,</hi> more honourable, to be a door<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keeper in the Houſe of God, then to dwell in the tents of the ungodly, that is, to execute the meaneſt office in the ſervice of God, then thoſe of greateſt renowne among the Heathen and Infidels. Therefore they have by ancient cuſtome even before the Conqueſt, amongſt other the ſolemnities of their Coronation, not only been girt with the regall ſword of Juſtice by the Lay Peers of the Land, as the embleme of their temporall authority, but anointed alſo by the Biſhops with the
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:62131:113"/>oyle of Prieſthood, as a mark unto us of their Eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſticall profeſſion and juriſdiction. And as they have <hi>habenam regni,</hi> put upon them, to expreſſe the one, ſo al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo have they <hi>ſtolam ſacerdotii,</hi> commonly called <hi>veſtem dalmaticam,</hi> as a <hi>Leviticall</hi> Ephod, to expreſſe the other. The reaſons of which, if we ſhall ſeek from the anci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Inſtitutions of the Church, it is apparent by the Epiſtle of <hi>Gregory</hi> the great, unto <hi>Aregius</hi> Biſhop of <hi>France,</hi>

                     </note> that this <hi>veſtis dalmatica,</hi> was of that reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence amongſt the Clergy of that time, that the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pall Church-men, no not the Biſhops themſelves, might wear it without licence of the Pope.

                  <p>The memory of this admirable Prince carrieth me from my purpoſe; but to return to it, his ſucceſſors have ever ſince been conſecrated, and thereby made capable of ſpirituall juriſdiction, and have accordingly uſed the ſame in all ages, and thought by the Pope to be ſo ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled unto it, that <hi>Nicholas</hi> 2. doubted not to commit the government of all the Churches of <hi>England</hi> unto <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> the Confeſſor, as by and by we ſhall more largely declare.

And touching that of <hi>France</hi> alſo, the meer right thereof reſteth up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his Majeſty of <hi>England,</hi> though <hi>de facto,</hi> another for the time poſſeſſeth it: So that in this point of unction, our Soveraign the King of <hi>England</hi> is amongſt the reſt of the Kings of Chriſtendome, at this day Peer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe and tranſcendent; and well therefore might <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Rufus</hi> ſay, that himſelf had all the liberties in his Kingdome which the Emperour challenged in his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. <hi>Mat. Pariſ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But I wonder, why the Papiſts ſhould ſo conſident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny the Kings of <hi>England</hi> to be capable of ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all juriſdiction, when Pope <hi>Nicholas</hi> 2. of whom wee ſpake before in an Epiſtle to King <hi>Edward</hi> the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſor, hath upon the matter agreed, that it may be ſo; for amongſt other priviledges that he there beſtoweth upon the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> of <hi>Weſtminſter</hi> then newly founded by that vertuous King; <hi>He granteth, and abſolutely confirmeth, that it ſhall for ever be a place
<pb n="180" facs="tcp:62131:115"/>of Regall Conſtitution and Conſecration, — and a perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall habitation of Monkes that ſhall be ſubject to no living creature, but the King himſelf, free from Epiſcopall ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice and authority, and where no Biſhop ſhall enter to give any orders, &amp;c.</hi> Tom. Concil. part 3. pa. 1129. a.</p>
                  <p>In which words I note, firſt, that the Kings of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in thoſe ancient days, being before their Corona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion meerly Lay perſons, were by their conſecration made <hi>candidati Eccleſiaſticae poteſtatis,</hi> and admitted to the adminiſtration thereof; for to what other purpoſe was Conſecration ordained, but to make ſecular things to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long unto the Temple, and Lay perſons to become ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred and Eccleſiaſticall? like <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtone in the time of the <hi>Morall</hi> Law, which preſently upon the anointing thereof became appropriate to the Houſe of God.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, he plainly maketh the King head of this Monaſtery, that is, of the place it ſelf, and of all the perſons and members therof, which then by conſequence he might likewiſe be of all other Eccleſiaſticall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and places through the whole Kingdome. And even that alſo he granteth in a ſort in the end of his Epiſtle, <hi>Vobis &amp; poſteris veſtris regibus committimus advocationem &amp; tuitionem ejuſdem loci, &amp; omnium totius Angliae Eccleſiarum, ut vice noſtra cum concilio Epiſcopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum &amp; Abbatum, conſtituatis ubique quae juſta ſunt.</hi> So that if the Kings of <hi>England</hi> be pleaſed to execute this Eccleſiaſticall authority as the Popes Vicar, then by this his Charter they are inveſted therewith; and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure the Clergy of <hi>Rome</hi> can never revoke it, being granted <hi>poſteris regibus:</hi> and the Epiſtles of the Popes, being as <hi>Barclayus</hi> ſaith of <hi>Nich.</hi> 1. to <hi>Michael</hi> the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour, as an Eccleſiaſticall Law, <hi>Lib. de poteſt.

                  <pb n="181" facs="tcp:62131:115"/>
                  <p>But in the mean time it is hereby evident, which I endeavour to prove, that the Kings of <hi>England</hi> are juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly capable of ſpirituall juriſdiction by the Popes own confeſſion, for which purpoſe onely I here alledge it. And to give more life to the matter, it appeareth by <hi>Baronius,</hi> that Pope <hi>Vrbane</hi> the granted not onely as much in the Kingdome of <hi>Sicil</hi> to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> being the anointed King thereof, but added alſo to that his Eccleſiaſticall juriſdiction, divers branches of ſpirituall power belonging meerly to the keys, and not to the ſword, that is, to the very function of a Biſhop, as namely, that of Excommunication. All which, though <hi>Baronius</hi> impugneth mainly to be of no validi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe that all things are void, (he ſaith) that the Church doth againſt her ſelf: yet the King of <hi>Spain</hi> both holdeth, and exerciſeth this function and juriſdi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction onely by the connivency of the Pope, but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein by Cardinall <hi>Aſcanius Colonna,</hi> againſt <hi>Baronius.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But to leave forain examples, and to goe on with our domeſticall precedents; It is manifeſt by other ancient Authorities, Charters, and Manuſcripts, that the Pope thereby granted no more to King <hi>Edward</hi> and his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, then the ſame King, and his Predeceſſors, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore aſſumed to themſelves. For this Epiſtle could not be written to S. <hi>Edward,</hi> before the end of his reign, (<hi>Ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholas</hi> not being Pope till then) and in the Laws of the ſame King, before that time publiſhed, himſelf doth plainly declare himſelf to be, <hi>Vicarius ſummi Regis,</hi> not <hi>ſummi pontificis:</hi> yea, and that in the government of the Church. For the words of his own Law, <gap reason="foreign">

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:62131:116"/>rule his earthly Kingdome, and the Lords people: and ſhould above all things worſhip his holy Church, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it, and defend it againſt them that would wrong it, and to pull the evill doers out of it, &amp;c.</hi> So that write the Pope what he will, S. <hi>Edward</hi> here taketh upon him to have the rule and government of the Church of <hi>England</hi> (committed to him from God, and not from the Pope) and to be Gods Vicar, not the Popes: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he imitated his predeceſſors; for King <hi>Edgar</hi> ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the government of the Church, ſaith in plain tearms, that it belonged to himſelf, <hi>ad nos</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſpectat.</hi> And becauſe <hi>Caſaubon</hi> in citing this place out of the Manuſcript, is charged by <hi>Parſons</hi> to falſifie it, and that it is, or ſhould be on the contrary, <hi>ad vos ſpectat, ſcil. Eccleſiaſticos:</hi> give me leave to defend that worthy man being now dead, in whoſe behalf I muſt avow that the originall is plainly <hi>ad nos,</hi> and not <hi>ad vos;</hi> which leſt it ſhould ſeem either miſtaken, or queſtionable, King <hi>Edgar</hi> himſelf doth manifeſtly clear it, both by deeds and words: for of his own authority he removed ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally the Clerks of that time, that were not profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, out of the Monaſteries, and placed in their rooms, Monks and regular perſons, as appeareth by his owne words, in his Charter of <hi>Malmesbury. (Malmsb. pag.</hi> 58. <hi>l.</hi> 17.) And alſo in the foundation Book of the <hi>Abbey</hi> of <hi>Wincheſter,</hi> written all in golden letters, wherein likewiſe he preſcribeth the rules for the government of the religious perſons there, and ſaith, that himſelf will look to the Monks, and that his wife <hi>Aelfthryth</hi> ſhall look to the Nuns. And leſt it ſhould ſeem that he had done this rather out of the will of a Prince, then by juſt authority, <hi>Hoveden,</hi> and <hi>Hiſtoria Jornalen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis,</hi> doe teſtifie, that he did it by the advice and means
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:62131:116"/>of <hi>Ethelwould,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Winton,</hi> and <hi>Oſwald,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Worceſter.</hi> So that the very Clergy of that time, agni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, executed, and affirmed his juriſdiction herein: which I will cloſe up with a materiall ſentence out of his Charter in <hi>Glaſtenberry,</hi> extant in <hi>Malmsbury de geſt. Reg. li.</hi> 2. <hi>pag.</hi> 57. where the words be theſe, <hi>Conceſsit e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiam</hi> (ſcil.

And in further declaration thereof doth by that his Charter by and by after prohibit all Biſhops from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling within the Iſle of <hi>Glaſtenberry:</hi> and leſt he ſhould ſeem to doe a new thing, he cloſeth it up with this a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pology, That his predeceſſors, <hi>Cemwines, Ines, Ethelar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dus, Cuthredus, Elfredus, Edwardus, Ethelſtanus, Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mundus,</hi> had all of them done the like; and he might have added out of <hi>Bede, l.</hi> 2. <hi>c.</hi> 7. that <hi>Cenwalch</hi> King of Weſt-Saxon, of his own authority divided the Sea of <hi>Agilbert</hi> his Biſhop, being a French man, and of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother language, which he underſtood not, and gave one part thereof unto <hi>Winus</hi> a man of his own Nation, which though he were afterwards compelled by neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity and diſcontent of <hi>Agilbert</hi> to reunite, yet his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor <hi>Inas,</hi> divided them again, and then they ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued. <hi>Hen.

For ſo likewiſe may the Popes own authority be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable, inſomuch as he alſo required the generall Synod, then holden at <hi>Rome, Anno</hi> 965. (as <hi>Malmsbur.</hi> ſaith) to confirm it. But the faſhion of thoſe times was, that ſecular Princes ſought ſometimes to have their temporall Laws confirmed by the Pope with a curſe againſt the breakers thereof, as did <hi>Howell Dhae,</hi> for thoſe his Laws of <hi>Wales;</hi> and in like manner was it uſuall for Councels and Synods to ſeek the confirma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Canons from temporall Princes, as did that of <hi>Orleans</hi> before ſpoken of from <hi>Clodoveus,</hi> and the Councell of <hi>Toledo</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>It may be objected, that <hi>Edgar</hi> being the great King of this whole Iſle, (for he ſtyled himſelf <hi>totius Albionis baſileus</hi>) might uſurp upon the Church, and doe theſe things rather in the will of a Prince, then by juſt au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority. It is manifeſt partly by that which I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, but plentifully by his Charters, that the Clergy of that time were ſo far from denying, or repining at this his juriſdiction, that they affirmed and ſubſcribed unto it, as appeareth in his Charters. And how large ſoever his Dominion was, his humility was as great, for though in matters of government he carried him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:62131:117"/>as the head Officer of the Church, yet in matters of faith he was ſo obedient, that to expiate his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinency with a Nun, he threw himſelf at the feet of <hi>Dunſtan</hi> his Biſhop, ſubmitted himſelf to ſeven years penance, and preſumed not to be conſecrated till the 14. year of his reign.</p>
                  <p>But theſe things were no novelties either in the perſon of <hi>Edgar,</hi> or in the Princes of thoſe ages; for the minor Kings themſelves within the orbs of their own Dominion uſed the like juriſdiction, as you may perceive by thoſe cited by <hi>Edgar,</hi> in the Charter of <hi>Gla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtenberry,</hi> and by many other in particular Charters of their own. Yea, the Kings of <hi>Mercia</hi> that were but vaſſals, and underlings to the Kings of Weſt-Saxony, within the limits of their little Kingdome uſed the ſame plenitude of authority, as appeareth by the Charter of <hi>Kenulphus,</hi> who lived about the year 850. made to the Abbot of <hi>Abingdon,</hi> wherein he ſaith, — <hi>Sit autem prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict' rus liberum ab omni regali obſtaculo, &amp; Epiſcopali jure, in ſempiternum aevum, ut habitantes ejus nullius re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gis aut miniſtrorum ſuorum, Epiſcopive aut ſuorum offici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alium jugo deprimantur, ſed in omnibus rerum eventibus ac defenſionibus cauſarum Abbatis Abbindenenſis, Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterii de caetero ſubjiciantur, Term.

                  </p>
                  <p>To leave the Saxon Kings, and to come to the <hi>Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans,</hi> that we may ſee by what channell this fluent of authority hath been deduced to his Majeſty. <hi>Lanfranc</hi> Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> in the Conquerours time, would have given the Abbotſhip of S. <hi>Auguſtines,</hi> but
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:62131:118"/>the new King, (ſaith the book) i. <hi>William</hi> the Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, did deny it, ſaying, <hi>that he would conferre all Paſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Staves in his Realm, and would not conferre that power to any whatſoever. Govern you</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that which apper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth to faith and Chriſtianity among the Monks, but for their outward ſervice, you ſhall let me alone with that.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>You ſee here, that the King doth not in covert man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, or by little and little, creep into Eccleſiaſticall ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction, but with an abſolute reſolution, whileſt he yet ſtood as it were but upon the threſhold of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and might juſtly fear ſome notable tranſmutati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in diſcontenting his Clergy, the halfe arch of his Kingdome, even then hee forbare not to conteſt with them upon points of juriſdiction, confining theirs un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to matters of faith, and extending his own to the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt limits of the outward government of the Church. But becauſe his hand and his ſeal doe more authentical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly enforce credit, then the report of Authours and Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtorians, ſee what he aſſumeth in his Charter of founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Monaſtery <hi>Sancti Martini de bello,</hi> commonly called <hi>Battail Abbey,</hi> for that he built it (as <hi>Romulus</hi> did the Capitol) in the place where he overcame his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies. In this Charter he granteth that, <hi>That Church ſhall be free from all ſervitude, and from all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever mans invention can imagine, — and commandeth therefore that it be free from all government of Biſhops — neither ſhall the Biſhop of</hi> Chicheſter, <hi>though it be in his Dioceſſe, make any Ordinations there, nor grieve it in any thing, nor execute any kind of government, or authority there; but that it be as free</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>from all his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, as my own Dominicall (or Demeſne) Chappell. The Abbot ſhall not be compelled to goe to the Synod, nor forbidden to promote his Monks to holy Orders, where him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:62131:118"/>liſteth; nor he, or his Monks to require what Biſhop they will to conſecrate Altars, &amp;c. And this alſo by my Regall authority, — I ordain, that the Abbot ſhall be Lord and Judge of all things in his own Church, and within one league round about it, &amp;c.</hi> ſee the Charter at large. Here it appeareth, that this victorious King <hi>Will.</hi> 1. took himſelf to have, <hi>Pallium Eccleſiaſticae juriſdictionis,</hi> the fulneſſe of Eccleſiaſticall power; and as the ſupream Magiſtrate thereof, not only abridgeth and revoketh the juriſdiction of other Biſhops within this place, as of the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> and the Biſhop of <hi>Chi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter,</hi> but diſpoſeth the ſame according to his owne pleaſure, namely, to the Abbey of <hi>Battail,</hi> with ſo great enlargement of priviledge and authority, as no Biſhop of the Kingdome hath the like. <hi>Free from all ſervitude, and from all things whatſoever mans invention can imagine,</hi> are exquiſite words of priviledge, and how far they might ſtretch at thoſe times, (when the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Laws was not a ſcience) into Regall, or Canonicall juriſdiction, I cannot judge: but I know by <hi>Staffords</hi> caſe, 1 <hi>H.</hi> 7. <hi>f.</hi> 18. they will now bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with many exceptions.

And leſt the King ſhould ſeem to have done this by ſome indulgence from the Pope, or
<pb n="288" facs="tcp:62131:119"/>connivency of his own Clergy, he ſaith expreſly, that he doth it by his <hi>Regall authority,</hi> and that not cloſely, or under-hand, but <hi>Epiſcoporum &amp; Baronum meorum atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</hi> And to declare how far the Clergy of that time was from repining or impugning this his juriſdiction, the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury,</hi> the Biſhops of <hi>Chiche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, Winton,</hi> and <hi>Worceſter,</hi> are witneſſes to the Charter, and denounce a curſe againſt the breakers thereof. One other thing alſo is worthy of note, that the Kings De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mean Chappell, ſeemeth by this, not to be within the juriſdiction and Dioceſſe of any Biſhop, but exempt and as a Regall peculiar reſerved onely to the viſita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and immediate government of the King, or ſuch as it pleaſeth him to ſubſtitute; for the Archbiſhop of <hi>Canterbury</hi> hath no juriſdiction there by his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, <hi>ut pat.
